To Everyone:

Thanks everyone for sending me your project proposals. Below is
specific feedback regarding your proposal. One thing that almost all
the proposals were missing was a specific explanation of what the
models/simulations were to be used for. This should include discussion
of what quantities need to be predicted/inferred, how those quantities
would be used and how well they need to be known.

Nick,

Your proposal to address the solar vortex problem is a good
one. Please be sure to think about the role of model inadequacy in
your analysis, since the models will include those known to be in
error (RANS). Also, be specific and explicit about what is known and
unknown. It is common to both under- and over-state what is known,
sometimes both at the same time.
