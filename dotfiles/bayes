# Deterministic Bayes

# given binary outcome, update expectations
# 
# -------------------------------------------
# example:
# 1% of women have breast cancer (and therefore 99% do not).
# 80% of mammograms detect breast cancer when it is there (and therefore 20% miss it).
# 9.6% of mammograms detect breast cancer when itâ€™s not there (and therefore 90.4% correctly return a negative result).
#
# posterior should be 7.76%
# -------------------------------------------

# prior
echo 'Prior Probability of Event?'
read x

# likelihood
echo 'Likelihood of observation corroborating hypothesis?'
read y

# evidence (false pos)
echo 'Likelihood of observation despite hypothesis (false positive)?'
read z

#
# update probability
#
echo ''
echo 'Probability is now: '
echo "scale=4; 100*($x*$y / ( $x*$y + $z*(1-$x) ))" | bc -l; echo "Percent"
