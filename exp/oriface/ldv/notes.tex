Since you have no reading to do, and no lab reports to work on, I wanted
to give you a little exercise for Monday.  What I would like you to do
is to do a literature search for measurements made with an LDV in an
area of interest to you―presumably an area in which you are doing
research.  For Monday I would like you to provide a document which
identifies the paper you found and lists a couple of interesting things
about the measurements made with the LDV system described in this paper.
