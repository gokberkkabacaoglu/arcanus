Title: Numerical Simulation of Synthetic, Buoyancy-Induced Columnar Vortices

Info: We will schedule a 1-hour seminar in the morning

Overall we like to see some technical depth and having some breadth too is a bonus.  
The audience will be mostly technical staff here with interests in fluid mechanics, 
code development, turbulence, UQ, machine learning, etc.  

It is fine to talk about your engineering application but for the purposes of this 
be sure to emphasize contributions you have made in the modeling of the system, 
whether it is physics modeling, optimization/UQ or numerics.
