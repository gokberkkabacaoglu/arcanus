 Much of the solar energy incident on the Earth's surface is absorbed
 into the ground, which in turn heats the air layer above the surface.
 This buoyant air layer contains considerable gravitational potential
 energy. The energy in this layer can drive the formation of columnar
 vortices (``Dust Devils'') which arise naturally in the atmosphere. A
 new energy harvesting approach 
 makes use of this phenomena by creating and anchoring the vortices
 artificially and extracting energy from them. In this document, 
 we explore the characteristics of these vortices
 through numerical simulation. Computational models of the turning vane 
 system which generates the vortex and the turbine used to extract
 energy have been developed and are presented here. These models have 
 been tested against available experimental measurements. 
 Results from these studies are investigated, and details of the
 columnar vortex structure. Finally, we introduce a new approach used to
 optimize the system configuration to maximize the power extraction. The
 objective of this work is to explore a wide variety of configurations
 to assess the technological feasibility of the overall endeavor.
