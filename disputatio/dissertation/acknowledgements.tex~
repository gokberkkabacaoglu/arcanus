This material is based in part upon work supported by the Department of
Energy National Nuclear Security Administration under Award Number
DE-FC52-08NA28615.

The author acknowledges the Institute for Computational Science and Engineering
in conjunction with the Texas Advanced Computing Center at The University of
Texas at Austin for providing high-performance computing resources that
contributed to the reported results.

% SUPERVISORS
% -----------
I would like to thank my advisor, Dr\@. Robert D\@. Moser, for the
unwavering support, warm guidance, and considerable latitude he granted
me throughout my doctoral studies.  I appreciate my committees' patience
and input.  In particular, I would like to thank Dr\@. Todd A\@. Oliver
for the years upon years he spent answering five minute questions that
often turned into hour-long discussions.

% ACADEMICS
% ---------
This thesis would not have happened without Dr\@. Victor Topalian's
willingness to help me apply his spatiotemporal homogenization approach
for which I am grateful.  Equally important to the research were the Orion
Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle solutions provided by Dr\@. Paul T\@. Bauman
building atop work by Drs\@. Roy H\@. Stogner and Benjamin S\@. Kirk.
Perspectives I learned from collaborating with Dr\@. Oleg Schilling
during two summers spent at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
greatly aided me.  He also graciously reviewed drafts of this document.
%
I owe much to Drs\@. Christopher S\@. Simmons and Karl W\@. Schulz for
software-related discussions and, along with the Sysnet group at the
Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, for the exceptional
computational and project infrastructure they provided.

% COLLEAGUES
% ----------
Thanks are extended to Dr\@. Jesse Chan, Dr\@. Henry Chang, Truman E\@. Ellis,
Myoungkyu Lee, Nicholas Malaya, and Dr\@. Nathan Roberts for many useful fluid
mechanics discussions of the sort too embarrassing to ask one's advisor.
Rebecca Morrison and Dr\@. Thomas Kirschenmann helped with similar probability
and statistics questions.  Dr\@.  Kemelli C\@. Estacio-Hiroms assisted with the
concepts behind the manufactured solution presented in the appendix and Dr\@.
Shan Yang showed how to accommodate the associated manufactured forcing within
the semi-implicit temporal scheme.  Dr\@.  Jesse Windle made several excellent
suggestions regarding the autoregressive uncertainty estimation technique.
Dr\@. Damon McDougall kindly answered many Matplotlib questions.  Thank you to
Nicholas, Damon, and Dr\@. Craig Michoski for reviewing thesis drafts.  I
appreciate just how often Myoungkyu, Thomas, Rebecca, Dr\@. Michael Borden and
Dr\@. Omar Al Hinai asked me to go grab lunch and how easily they could be
talked into it themselves.

% FAMILY
% ------
My extended family, by birth and by marriage, has been incredibly
supportive throughout this seven-year journey.  Thank you to my parents
for all the times they provided an ear or a hug or both.  Finally, I
cannot say thank you enough to my wife Michelle for her love, for her
understanding, and for our children.
