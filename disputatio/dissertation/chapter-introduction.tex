\section{Motivation}

Renewable energy is critical to our environmental, economic, and
national security. Global demand for energy is projected to rise 56\% by
2040\cite{energy-outlook}, which will coincide with our national
reliance on fossil fuel-based power plants for the bulk of our
electricity generation. There is a critical need for safe, clean, and 
cost-effective alternatives to coal, such as wind, solar, hydroelectric,
and geothermal power. These technologies will simultaneously reduce
carbon dioxide emissions and help position the U.S. as a leader in the
global renewable energy industry.

This thesis documents a research effort that has performed a numerical
investigation and design optimization of a novel renewable energy concept. 

Much of the solar energy incident on the Earth's surface is absorbed
into the ground, which in turn heats the air layer above the surface.
This buoyant air layer contains considerable gravitational potential
energy. 
With nearly one-third of global land mass covered by deserts, there are huge
untapped regions for capturing solar heat (about 200 W/$\text{m}^2$
averaged over a 24-hour day, and up to 1000 W/$\text{m}^2$
peak)\cite{Hoyt197827}. The available power is competitive in magnitude
with worldwide power generation from fossil sources. If a technology
could effectively extract this energy, it would result in a low-cost,
scalable approach to electrical power generation that could create a new
class of renewable energy ideally suited for arid regions.  

How then, is one to efficiently extract this gravitational potential
energy and convert it into usable work? We turn to Nature to provide a 
guide, with the observation that there are natural objects that provide
precisely this mechanism. Namely, naturally occurring ``dust devils'' 
characterized by a vertically stratified, ground-heated air layer
that produces a coherent columnar vortex. These ``dust devil''s are
ubiquitous, naturally appearing in regions as diverse as Arizona,
Siberia, over water, or even
Mars\cite{Sinclair1969,ROG:ROG1635,JGRE:JGRE1660}.

They are observed to occur over a wide range of length scales (1 - 30
meters) with large variations in velocities (1 to over 40
m/s)\cite{Sinclair1969}. 

The basic idea behind the proposed energy harvesting approach is to convert the 
potential energy in this buoyant air layer to kinetic energy in an
anchored vortex, and to use that kinetic energy to drive a
vertical-axis turbine coupled with an electric generator  to
produce electrical power. 
The Solar-Driven Vortex (SoV) phenomena has been demonstrated in
an experimental setup by our partners at Georgia Tech. However, to 
move beyond proof-of-concept, Computational Fluid 
Dynamics (CFD) must be used to simulate the SoV. Such simulations will 
provide fundamental insight into the 
driving dynamics of the system and generate high resolution data, which is
experimentally inaccessible, to be used to rapidly optimize the
geometry and configuration of the SoV apparatus. 

%This is a considerable effort.

\section{Objectives}

The objective of this thesis is to assess the technological feasibility of 
using synthetic columnar vortices to generate usable energy. 

We propose a course of investigation designed to broadly probe the
design space and provide a definitive assessment of the technological
feasibility of the entire synthetic columnar vortex concept. 

We considered feasibility in the context of just technological scaling,
not economic cost.  

all steps to this... math, software, etc. 

\section{Outline}

The thesis is outlined as follows. Chapter \ref{sec:physics} begins
with a discussion of the naturally occurring phenomenon, the presently
understood dynamics of dust-devils and similar columnar vortices, and
the implications for systems designed to generate their synthetic
counterparts.  
In Chapter \ref{sec:mathmodel} we outline a mathematical model of
the entire system, and in Chapter \ref{sec:software}, we discuss the
algorithms and software implementation used to simulate the
system. Chapter \ref{sec:validation} discusses the 
validation of simulations against existing experimental data and high
fidelity simulations. 
Chapter \ref{sec:results} examines the simulation results in detail, to
discern the physical processes driving the SoV.   
Chapter \ref{sec:field} details final system
design, as well as the predicted performance in the field.

Finally, with the preceding sections outlining the present simulation
capabilities and predictions, Chapter \ref{sec:conclusions} concludes
with a discussion of the ultimate technological feasibility of the
venture.
