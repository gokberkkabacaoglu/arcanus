\todo{finish archived appendix}

Two general types of data have been captured from each completed
simulation and archived on the Corral\footnote{%
    \texttt{lonestar:/corral-tacc/utexas/pecos/turbulence/thesis-rhys-chapter\{5,6,7\}/}
}
and Ranch\footnote{%
    \texttt{rhys@ranch:\{cevisslam,channels\}/}
}
resources at the Texas Advanced Computing Center\footnote{%
