%\section{Physics of Dust Devils}
\label{sec:physics}

This chapter addresses what is known about naturally occurring dust
devils, to motivate how best to \textit{engineer} a synthetic version. 
It begins with a qualitative discussion of dust-devils, followed by a
review of the known physics and pertinent literature. It concludes 
with an plan to leverage these physical processes as a method of
usable energy generation. 


\section{Phenomenological Character of Dust Devils}
\label{subsec:phenomena}

There is no rigorous definition of a dust devil, despite the fact that
the phenomenon is ubiquitous. These whirlwinds have been
observed across a wide variety of terrains, climates and even on several
other planets\cite{Sinclair1969,Bluestein2004,JGR:JGR13978,JGRE:JGRE1660}. 
While a precise definition is elusive, several features 
are characteristic of a dust devil. They are regions of
intense vorticity and rotation, coupled with strong upward motions 
that are strong enough draw and lift particles into the flow.
These self-sustaining vortices maintain a funnel-like
chimney driven by hot air moving both upward and circularly. 
While they typically survive for only a few minutes, they have
been observed to endure hours. The velocities are 
typically several meters per second, but

dust devils are occasionally strong enough to cause damage and injury,
with some reaching F1 on the Fujita Tornado intensity
scale\cite{Edwards_tornadointensity}, with velocities between 33 and 49
m/s.

Diameters range from about one meter to greater than thirty.  Their
average height is about thirty meters, but a few have been observed 
as high as one kilometer or more. They do not appear to have a
preferred rotation direction. Although the vertical velocity 
is predominantly upward, the flow along the a central axis of large dust
devils may be downward.

% The reason for this is that the ExoMars Lander will measure electric fields on Mars.
%Moreover, actual dust devils have been photographed from orbit, with
%some of them as large as 1 to 2 kilometers across at their base and 10
%km tall. 
Visibly similarly structured phenomena have been observed over water, in
intense forest fires, and in cold or freezing environments.

%This is to say nothing of other similar cyclonic phenomena, such as
%tornados and hurricanes. 

While the phenomenon is pervasive, certain 
environmental conditions impact the frequency of dust devil formation.
Sinclair\cite{Sinclair1969} performed perhaps the most 
systematic investigation characterizing conditions favorable for
formation. He noted that dust devils are most
likely to form at solar noon, the time of the greatest incident radiation 
on the ground. Furthermore, they are more likely to form in locations 
with a higher surface temperature. Moderate to high wind speeds (2-5
m/s) encourage dust devil genesis, but greater velocities (11 m/s)
appear to impede formation. They are more likely to be observed in
relatively flat locations, such as deserts.  

Numerical simulations of dust devils have been previously
reported.\todo{expand this greatly}
However, they are typically large eddy simulations (LES) that point
towards the spontaneous occurance of similar phenomena within existing
climate and atmospheric
models\cite{QJ:QJ200513160722,doi:10.3137/ao.420105}. Actual
measurements made inside a dust devil are limited. The available data
hints that dust devils contain two regions: a low surface layer and a
higher invisid region. The low surface region is the  principle location
of radial inflow. At the top of this region the flow 
reaches its peak velocity, with that peak dropping with increasing height. 
The strong radial and azimuthal flow is drawn into a low pressure core 
where it gains vertical velocity. Earlier experimental and 
computational studies have observed a ``two-cell'' structure
characterized by a cool downdraft in the center of stronger dust
devils\cite{doi:10.3137/ao.420105,Sinclair1973}. It is not clear what
generates the azimuthal velocities. It is possible that ambient
vorticity in the atmosphere is drawn into the vortex from the far field,
and intensifies due to vortex stretching.  

The higher region is characterized by a largely invisid potential flow
region with warm air rising and circling around a cool, low pressure
core. This region is typically many times larger in height than the
surface layer. While this region also has radial inflow, it is
significantly weaker than the lower region. Previous studies have found
this region is relatively well described by a Rankine vortex
model\cite{Sinclair1973}. These regions are indicated in a 
simple cartoon in Figure \ref{fig:cartoon}.

\section{Estimate of Energy Scaling}

Here we provide a rough estimate of the energy
available to a dust devil. There are two objectives of this
analysis. The first is to provide justification for the concept of
extracting energy from them, with the reasoning that should
sufficient energy be available, then attempting to extract it might be
worthwhile. The second objective is to provide a simple analysis that
can serve as a measure of the efficiency of the generation process,
e.g. ``What fraction of the available energy are we extracting?''.  

Steady state conditions requires that the dust devil not
extract more energy than is provided by the thermal resource, the Sun.   
The peak direct solar insolation in Arizona on a hot summer day is
greater than 1000 $W/m^2$. However, this estimate is problematic. 
It is in some sense an optimistic upper bound, as dust devils are only
converting a fraction of this solar resource into kinetic
energy. Renno and Ingersoll\cite{renno_inger} used an idealized heat
engine frame-work to study natural convection and to propose a theory
for convective available potential energy (CAPE), however, the
predictions from this underestimate the observed velocities in the real
objects. Furthermore, It is not clear how large of a region that dust
devils draw their energy from. Finally, dust devils are highly
intermittent creatures, typically existing only for a short time. It is
not certain that they are able to be accurately represented in a steady
state context. Lending some credence to this are the measurements of
\cite{} which found that surface heat fluxes could rise to . 

Sinclair's measurements of the velocity profiles inside a dust 
devil provides a more direct estimate. A velocity profile taken 
at approximately 9 meter height is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sinclair_profile}. 

  \begin{figure}[!htb]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics[width = 20 cm]{figs/sinclair_cut}
     \caption{Sinclair Profile}
     \label{fig:sinclair_profile}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

This is a dust devil with an inner core radius of approximately 
6 meters, and tangential and axial velocities of 11 and 10 m/s, respecively. 
This profile can be integrated to provide an estimate of the power though this plane, 
\begin{equation}
 P = -\frac{\rho }{2} \int V_z (V_{\theta}^2 + V_z^2 ) dA, 
\end{equation}
which results in an estimate of 24 kW. This is a substantial amount of
energy. 

%
% show what sinclair measured, then show how we think these energies
% break down into kinetic vs wind
%

As alluded to above, the energy composition of these flows is of
interest. For instance, Carroll and Ryan\cite{JGR:JGR14185} %1970
found that the kinetic energy contained within a dust devil exceeds that
which is attributable to buoyancy. Furthermore, Kaimal and Busigner
observed that dust devils possessed an order of magnitude greater
vertical flux in kinetic and than similarly sized convective
plumes~\cite{doi:10.1175/1520-0450(1970)009<0612:CSOACP>2.0.CO;2}. The
interplay between rotation, ambient winds and thermal potential energy
are critical to velocity intensities observed in these phenomena. 

As an example of this, consider only the energy flowing into the
entrainment region due to the ambient conditions, in particular, the
incoming wind and heat flowing through a cylindrical region. A
medium-sized (3m radius) dust devil with an incoming 
freestream velocity of 5 m/s. The surface temperature is 343 Kelvin,
with a specified inflow boundary layer bridging the ground temperature
to the ambient air conditions of 313 Kelvin.\todo{convert to same as

provided by the Georgia Tech field team from measurements performed in
Arizona during the summer of 2014.} 

There are two forms of energy to consider: kinetic and gravitational
potential. First, we examine the kinetic energy flux through the front
of the apparatus. 
%From the first law of thermodynamics we can express
The kinetic energy flux is a surface integral over the upstream face of
the device,  
\begin{equation*}
\text{KE} = \int \frac{\vec V^2}{2} \rho \vec V \cdot \hat n \, dA.
\end{equation*}
%

% pg. 239
%
Several simplifying assumptions are made. The freestream 
velocity is assumed to have no components in the span and height and
the variation in height of the streamwise
velocity is only due to the thin boundary layer near the
ground. The boundary layer profile is modeled using the common 7th
power function for a turbulent boundary layer,  
\begin{equation*}
  u(z) = U \text{ min }\left(\left(\frac{z}{\delta}\right)^7,1\right)
\end{equation*}
where U is the constant freestream velocity and $\delta$ the assumed
boundary layer thickness. 
The result for the kinetic energy is then, 
\begin{align*}
\text{KE} & = R \rho U^3 \left[ z_{\text{max}} - \frac{10}{11}\delta
\right].
\end{align*}
Where R is the radius of the vortex. Typical values of these quantities
are, $U = 5$ m/s, $\rho = 1.225$ Kg/$\text{m}^3$, $R = 3$ m,
$z_{\text{max}} = 2.5$ m and $\delta \approx 10$ cm. This provides an
estimate of 1144 Watts as the incoming kinetic energy flux. 

The gravitational potential energy flux is estimated by integrating the
boussinesq potential energy flux over the upstream flow. 
This is the maximum energy that could be extracted from the flow by an 
adiabatic redistribution of the density variation from the ambient 
density of the freestream flow, $\rho_\infty$. 
This potential energy ($E_p$) has the form of a surface integral over 
the front half of the vanes, 
\begin{align*}
  E_p & = \int u(z) (\rho(z)-\rho_\infty) g z dA. 
\end{align*}
As the density only varies with height, the integral is simplified to only vary in 
this direction
\begin{align*}
  E_p  & = g \int^{z_\text{max}}_0 u(z) (\rho(z)-\rho_\infty) \, z  \pi
 R \, dz.
\end{align*}
Using the bousinesq approximation, $(\rho(z)-\rho_\infty)  = \rho_0 \beta \Delta T$,
%\begin{align*}
%   (\rho(z)-\rho_\infty) & = - \rho_0 \beta \Delta T 
%   (\rho(z)-\rho_\infty) & = - \rho_0 \beta (T(z) - T_\infty),
%\end{align*}
the integral becomes, 
\begin{align*}
  E_p & = g  \pi R \beta \rho_0 \Delta T \int^{z_\text{max}}_0 u(z) \, z dz.
\end{align*}
This is solved to show
\begin{align*}
  E_p & = g  \pi R \beta \rho_0 U \Delta T \left[ \frac{z_\text{max}^2}{2} - \frac{7 \delta^2}{18} \right].
\end{align*}

Characteristic values for a dust devil are $\rho_0 = 1.225$ Kg/$\text{m}^3$, 
$\Delta T= 30$ Kelvin, $\beta = 0.003194$ (This is 1/$T_{\text{ground}}$), 
$R = 3 $ m, $z_\text{max} = 2.5$ m, $\delta \approx 10$ cm, $g=9.81$ m/$s^2$, and a
freestream velocity of five meters per second results in an estimate of 34 Watts %33.82 Watts 
for the gravitational potential energy. 

The majority of the available energy is thus in the kinetic energy of
the wind, not the gravitational potential energy of the actual air.

%This is inconsistent with the results of
%Renno\cite{}\todo{missing cite here}, who demonstrated

the energy available, that does not imply it is without significant
impact. 
%The extent to which the thermal energy acts as an assisting mechanism for

Given the observed increase in dust devil formation during peak thermal
gradients, it is expected to play an important role.

\section{Dust Devil Generation Concept}

The preceding discussion suggests that dust devils are carriers of
significant levels of ambient kinetic and gravitational potential energy
from the environment. This subsection provides a brief discussion of how
the physics of dust devils informs the generation of a synthetic
variety, that might be used as a means of extracting usable work.  

In contrast to the naturally occuring dust devils,
our synthetic solar driven vortex (SoV) design makes use of
control surfaces. These turning vanes also serve as an anchor for the
synthetic vortex, locking it into a small region. An abstract concept of
the turning vane geometry is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cartoon_vanes}.

  \begin{figure}[!htb]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics[width = 8 cm]{figs/ground_vanes}
     \caption{Image of a possible two tier turning vane 
       configuration for generating synthetic dust devils. This image depicts a 
       vertical slice through the proposed configuration, and does not show the reflection 
       of the two tier turning vanes, which would be expected to encircle the dust devil core.}
     \label{fig:cartoon_vanes}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

% Our observations of the naturally occuring dust devils informs some of
% our \textit{a priori} expectations for the design of the turning
% vanes. The bottom tier are designed to reside in the lower region, where
% the principle inflow will occur. We therefore expect a radial or nearly
% radial start to the vanes, which becomes increasingly tangential as the
% flow moves towards the center. The inner radius of the bottom tier will
% correspond to the outer radius of the generated vortex. 

% The top tier serves a different purpose. We expect a non-zero initial
% angle, as this tier is also designed to protect the rising vortex from
% being blow away by ambient winds. The vanes radius will be shorter, as
% the flow from this tier becomes entrained and the vortex grows in
% size. 

% For both the upper and lower tiers, our objective is to strike a balance
% between effectively turning the incoming flow to impart azimuthal
% velocity, while simultaneously not introducing such a high angle that
% the vanes act as a blocking surface which the incoming flow will move
% around. For instance, when the inlet angles are too severe, the vanes
% block the incoming flow, which results in an adverse pressure gradient
% existing near the outside edge of the 
% vanes. This serves to force fluid around and over the system, instead
% of inside the turning vanes. This reduces the velocity of flow inside
% the system, resulting in a weaker thermal vortex.  To reduce
% the flow blockage, we use gently curving vanes. A gentler angle permits
% more flow to enter the vane region, after which the curvature increases
% toward the center of the vanes. In this way, the angle smoothly varies
% between a nearly zero angle at the outside edge of the vanes to a
% maximum angle at a specified inner radius.

The characteristics of natural dust devils shown in Figure
\ref{fig:cartoon} suggest that the turning vanes be structured with two
tiers (see Figure \ref{fig:cartoon_vanes}). The lower tier would be
designed to manipulate the surface layer 
that lifts up into the core of the vortex, while the upper tier would
control entrainment into the vortex. In both tiers, the design of the
turning vanes must balance between the need to turn the flow from the
radial direction to the azimuthal direction to create vortical motion
and the requirement to not block flow into the vortex. Furthermore, in
the presence of a cross wind, the vanes need to prevent flow that
would pass right through the device, which would disrupt the vortex.
Finally, in field tests of design concepts for a solar vortex device
conducted by our colleagues at the Georgia Tech, it was found that cross
winds over the facility will also disrupt the vortical flow, and that
this could be controlled by introducing a conical wind-block on top of
the upper tier of vanes. One such field test configuration is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:field_test}. Within this broad conceptual design, there
remains a large design space to explore, including design parameters for
both tiers of vanes and the wind-block cone.

  \begin{figure}[!htb]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics[width = 8 cm]{figs/sov_field}
     \caption{An image of the field configuration from the June, 2015
     tests in Arizona. The second (upper) tier of vanes and the cone are
     clearly visible. This apparatus has an outer diameter of
     approximately three meters.}
     \label{fig:field_test}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

To extract energy from the synthetic dust devil formed by the vane
system described briefly above, a turbine would be placed near the top
of the upper vanes. The turbine would extract energy from both the
vertical and azimuthal flow in the vortex, and so the design
considerations are different from those for a classical wind turbine.
Furthermore, there is presumably an analog to the Betz limit on how
much of the energy can be extracted, without disrupting the flow so
much that the vortex cannot be maintained. This will need to be
explored as part of the turbine design process.

In the research proposed here, the design and performance of a dust
devil energy harvesting system will be explored using computational
models. Computer models will enable a more extensive exploration of
the design space than would be possible experimentally. The design
concept described above will be analyzed to maximize the the
power that can be generated by the system and to develop scaling
describing how power depends on device size, wind speed and thermal
conditions. Further new design concepts that may be formulated will
also be evaluated. The subsequent section will provide the mathematical
representation used to model the system.

% Our principle objective is to use a synthetic dust devil to produce 
% usable work. To extract the energy from the synthetic dust
% devil, a turbine is placed 
% at or near the top of the second tier of turning vanes. 
% The blades of the turbine will be driven by the dust devil's azimuthal
% and vertical velocities. While the Betz limit\cite{betz} gives a reasonable
% expectation of the efficiency with which energy can be expected to be
% extracted from the ambient dust devil velocity field, there are other
% non-trivial design considerations. In particular, the impact of the
% turbine on the dust devil's vortex, and any potential disruption of the
% flow on account of the turbine must be investigated. Optimizing the
% turbine to maximize the energy extraction while simultaneously
% minimizing it's impact on the character of the dust devil's solution
% will be an important issue.

% While the turning vanes and turbine  
% paradigm represents a reasonable starting point for design, the
% parameter space of possible system configurations is large. It is
% unclear how to engineer an effective SoV system. Important design
% consideration include: 
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item How should the turning vanes be configured?
%   \item How does the energy produced scale with system diameter?
%   \item Are additional surfaces, such as a cone, capable of increasing energy output?
% \end{itemize}

% Questions such as these provide the principle impetus of using
% computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to inform system design. The
% parameter space of conceivable system designs is far larger than can be
% probed experimentally, and even if such a campaign were to be embarked
% upon, it would be at significantly greater temporal and monetary
% cost. The subsequent chapter will provide the mathematical basis by which
% we model the system, so that we can then begin to discuss how we might
% optimize it computationally.
