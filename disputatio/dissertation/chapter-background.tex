%\section{Physics of Dust Devils}
\label{sec:physics}

This chapter addresses what is known about naturally occurring dust
devils, to motivate how best to \textit{engineer} a synthetic version. 
It begins with a qualitative discussion of dust-devils, followed by a
review of the known physics and pertinent literature. 
We then introduce a novel concept to leverage these
physical processes as a method of usable energy generation. 
The chapter concludes with a brief survey of previous
approaches related to harvesting gravitational potential energy.


\section{Phenomenological Character of Dust Devils}
\label{subsec:phenomena}

There is no rigorous definition of a dust devil, despite the fact that
the phenomenon is ubiquitous. These whirlwinds have been
observed across a wide variety of terrains, climates and even on
other planets\cite{Sinclair1969,Bluestein2004,JGR:JGR13978,JGRE:JGRE1660}. 
While a precise definition is elusive, several features 
are characteristic of a dust devil. These self-sustaining vortices
maintain a funnel-like chimney driven by hot air moving both upward and 
circularly. They are regions of intense vorticity and rotation, coupled
with upward motions that are strong enough draw and lift particles into
the flow. It is the entrainment of dust that gives the eponymous
whirlwind its striking visual appearance as a violent coherent
structure.   

While there are characteristic features of a dust devil, they exist over 
a wide range of scales and conditions. While they typically survive for
only a few minutes, they have been observed to endure hours. The
velocities are generally several meters per second, but

dust devils are occasionally strong enough to cause damage and injury,

Diameters range from about one meter to greater than thirty.  Their
average height is on the order of tens of meters, but a few have been
observed as high as one kilometer or more. They do not have a
preferred rotation direction\cite{?}. Although the vertical velocity 
is predominantly upward, the flow along the a central axis of large dust
devils may be downward.

%This is to say nothing of other similar cyclonic phenomena, such as
%tornados and hurricanes. 

While the phenomenon is pervasive, certain environmental conditions
impact the frequency of dust devil formation. 
Sinclair\cite{Sinclair1969} performed perhaps the most 
systematic investigation characterizing conditions favorable for
formation. He noted that dust devils are most
likely to form at solar noon, the time of the greatest incident solar
radiation  on the ground. Furthermore, they are more likely to form in
locations with a higher surface temperature. Moderate to high wind
speeds (2-5 m/s) encourage dust devil genesis, but greater velocities
(11 m/s) impede formation. They form more frequently in relatively flat
locations, such as deserts.

Actual measurements made inside a dust devil are limited. The available data
hints that dust devils contain two regions: a low surface layer and a
higher invisid region. The low surface region is the  principle location
of radial inflow. At the top of this region the flow 
reaches its peak velocity, with that peak dropping with increasing height. 
The strong radial and azimuthal flow is drawn into a low pressure core 
where it gains vertical velocity. Earlier experimental and 
computational studies have observed a ``two-cell'' structure
characterized by a cool downdraft in the center of stronger dust
devils\cite{doi:10.3137/ao.420105,Sinclair1973}. 

The higher region is characterized by a largely invisid potential flow
region with warm air rising and circling around a cool, low pressure
core. This region is typically many times larger in height than the
surface layer. While this region also has radial inflow, it is
significantly weaker than the lower region. Previous studies have found
this region is relatively well described by a Rankine vortex
model\cite{Sinclair1973}. These regions are indicated in a 
simple cartoon in Figure \ref{fig:cartoon}.

Renewed interest in naturally occurring dust devils has resulted from
the observation of them on Mars, first photographed by the NASA's Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter\cite{?}, and more recently by the Mars rover,
Opportunity. Their presence on Mars, with 1/100 of the atmospheric
density of the Earth, speaks to the universal character of the
phenomenon. Due to the greatly decreased atmospheric density, the
Martian dust devils are substantially larger, ranging several kilometers
across at their base and over ten kilometers tall. This interest in dust
devils and dust electrification is due to interest in the implications for
atmospheric mixing and transport, in particular as the ExoMars Lander
will measure electric fields on Mars\cite{renno_comm}.

Numerical simulations of dust devils have been previously
reported. While these studies have observed dust
devil like convective vortices, they have been observed in within
existing climate and atmospheric
models\cite{QJ:QJ200513160722,doi:10.3137/ao.420105}, not in simulation 
codes designed specifically to probe the dynamics of a dust devil. 
%\cite{smith_leslie,zhao}

It is not clear what generates the azimuthal velocities. Two major
hypotheses attempting to explain the behavior exists. The first is that
that ambient vorticity in the atmosphere is drawn into the vortex from
the far field, and intensifies due to vortex stretching\cite{?}. %
The other conjecture is that vorticity is generated by
vortex tilting. In this model, the rotation originates by twisting
horizontal vorticity, which is generated by variations in
temperature\cite{?}. %toigo 1-12

\section{Estimate of Dust Devil Power}
\label{sec:estimate_power}

Here we provide a rough estimate of the power
available to a dust devil. There are two objectives of this
analysis. The first is to provide justification for the concept of
extracting power from them, with the reasoning that should
sufficient power be available, then attempting to extract it might be
worthwhile. The second objective is to provide a simple analysis that
can serve as a measure of the efficiency of the generation process,
e.g. ``What fraction of the available power are we extracting?''.  

Steady state conditions requires that the dust devil not
extract more energy than is provided by the thermal resource, the Sun.   
The peak direct solar insolation in Arizona on a hot summer day is
greater than 1000 $W/m^2$. However, this estimate is problematic. 
On one hand it is an optimistic upper bound, as dust devils are only
converting a fraction of this solar resource into kinetic
energy. On the other hand, it is not clear how large of a region
that dust devils draw their energy from. 
Furthermore, Renno and Ingersoll\cite{renno_inger} used an
idealized heat engine frame-work to study natural convection and to
propose a theory for convective available potential energy (CAPE),
and found that the predictions from this substantially underestimate the
observed velocities in the real objects. Finally, dust devils are highly 
intermittent, typically existing only for a short time. It is
not certain that they are accurately represented in a steady
state context. Lending some credence to this are the measurements of
Renno\cite{?} which found that instantaneous surface heat fluxes could
rise to two or three times the average solar insolation. 

Sinclair's anomometer measurements of the velocity profiles inside a dust 
devil provides a more direct estimate. A velocity profile taken 
at approximately 9 meter height is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sinclair_profile}. 

  \begin{figure}[!htb]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics[width = 18 cm]{figs/sinclair_cut}
     \caption{An example of the velocity profiles from Sinclair's 1973
     study of the inner structure of a dust devil. These profiles can be
     integrated to provide a direct estimate of the power contained
     inside one of these objects.}
     \label{fig:sinclair_profile}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

This is a dust devil with an inner core radius of approximately 
5 meters, and tangential and axial velocities of 10 m/s, respectively. 
This profile can be integrated to provide an estimate of the power
though this plane,  
\begin{equation}
 P = -\frac{\rho }{2} \int V_z (V_{\theta}^2 + V_z^2 ) dA, 
\end{equation}
which results in an estimate of 45 kW. This is a substantial amount of
power. This calculation is detailed in Appendix \ref{scaling}. 

%
% show what sinclair measured, then show how we think these energies
% break down into kinetic vs wind
%

As alluded to above, the energy composition of these flows is of
interest. For instance, Carroll and Ryan\cite{JGR:JGR14185} %1970
found that the kinetic energy contained within a dust devil exceeds that
which is attributable to buoyancy. Furthermore, Kaimal and Busigner
observed that dust devils possessed an order of magnitude greater
vertical flux in kinetic and than similarly sized convective
plumes~\cite{doi:10.1175/1520-0450(1970)009<0612:CSOACP>2.0.CO;2}. The
interplay between rotation, ambient winds and thermal potential energy
are critical to velocity intensities observed in these phenomena. 

As an example of this, consider only the energy flowing into the
entrainment region due to the ambient conditions, in particular, the
incoming wind and heat flowing through a cylindrical region. A
medium-sized (3m radius) dust devil with an incoming 
freestream velocity of 5 m/s. The surface temperature is 343 Kelvin,
with a specified inflow boundary layer bridging the ground temperature
to the ambient air conditions of 313 Kelvin.

There are two forms of energy to consider: kinetic and gravitational
potential. First, we examine the kinetic energy flux through the front
of the apparatus. 
%From the first law of thermodynamics we can express
The kinetic energy flux is a surface integral over the upstream face of
the device,  
\begin{equation*}
\text{KE} = \int \frac{\vec V^2}{2} \rho \vec V \cdot \hat n \, dA.
\end{equation*}
%
% could cite fluid dynamics book here
% pg. 239
%
Several simplifying assumptions are made. The freestream 
velocity is assumed to have no components in the span and height and
the variation in height of the streamwise
velocity is only due to the thin boundary layer near the
ground. The boundary layer profile is modeled using the common 7th
power function for a turbulent boundary layer,  
\begin{equation*}
  u(z) = U \text{ min }\left(\left(\frac{z}{\delta}\right)^7,1\right)
\end{equation*}
where U is the constant freestream velocity and $\delta$ the assumed
boundary layer thickness. 
The result for the kinetic energy is then, 
\begin{align*}
\text{KE} & = R \rho U^3 \left[ z_{\text{max}} - \frac{10}{11}\delta
\right].
\end{align*}
Where R is the radius of the vortex. Typical values of these quantities
are, $U = 5$ m/s, $\rho = 1.225$ Kg/$\text{m}^3$, $R = 3$ m,
$z_{\text{max}} = 3$ m and $\delta \approx 10$ cm. This provides an
estimate of 1144 Watts as the incoming kinetic energy flux. 

The gravitational potential energy flux is estimated by integrating the
boussinesq potential energy flux over the upstream flow. 
This is the maximum energy that could be extracted from the flow by an 
adiabatic redistribution of the density variation from the ambient 
density of the freestream flow, $\rho_\infty$. 
This potential energy ($E_p$) has the form of a surface integral over 
the front half of the vanes, 
\begin{align*}
  E_p & = \int u(z) (\rho(z)-\rho_\infty) g z dA. 
\end{align*}
As the density only varies with height, the integral is simplified to only vary in 
this direction
\begin{align*}
  E_p  & = g \int^{z_\text{max}}_0 u(z) (\rho(z)-\rho_\infty) \, z  \pi
 R \, dz.
\end{align*}
Using the bousinesq approximation, $(\rho(z)-\rho_\infty)  = \rho_0 \beta \Delta T$,
%\begin{align*}
%   (\rho(z)-\rho_\infty) & = - \rho_0 \beta \Delta T 
%   (\rho(z)-\rho_\infty) & = - \rho_0 \beta (T(z) - T_\infty),
%\end{align*}
the integral becomes, 
\begin{align*}
  E_p & = g  \pi R \beta \rho_0 \Delta T \int^{z_\text{max}}_0 u(z) \, z dz.
\end{align*}
This is solved to show
\begin{align*}
  E_p & = g  \pi R \beta \rho_0 U \Delta T \left[ \frac{z_\text{max}^2}{2} - \frac{7 \delta^2}{18} \right].

Characteristic values for a dust devil are $\rho_0 = 1.225$ Kg/$\text{m}^3$, 
$\Delta T= 30$ Kelvin, $\beta = 0.003194$ (This is 1/$T_{\text{ground}}$), 
$R = 3 $ m, $z_\text{max} = 2.5$ m, $\delta \approx 10$ cm, $g=9.81$ m/$s^2$, and a
freestream velocity of five meters per second results in an estimate of
103 Watts for the gravitational potential energy. 

The majority of the available energy is thus in the kinetic energy of
the wind, not the gravitational potential energy of the actual air. 
% todo: think about renno
%This is inconsistent with the results of
%Renno\cite{}\todo{missing cite here}, who demonstrated
%that the available thermal energy present was not sufficient to account
%for the velocities measured in dust devils. 
However, while the gravitational potential energy is a small fraction of
the energy available, that does not imply it is without significant
impact. 
%The extent to which the thermal energy acts as an assisting mechanism for 
%``lifting-up'' the flow is unclear, but 
Given the observed increase in dust devil formation during peak thermal
gradients, it is expected to play an important role. The interplay
between the thermal and wind are examined in detail in Section
\ref{sec:wind_impact}. 

\section{Dust Devil Generation Concept}

The discussion in \ref{sec:estimate_power} suggests that dust devils are
carriers of significant levels of ambient kinetic and gravitational
potential energy from the environment. This subsection provides a brief
discussion of how the physics of dust devils informs the generation of a
synthetic variety, that might be used as a means of extracting usable work.  

In contrast to the naturally occuring dust devils,
our synthetic solar driven vortex (SoV) design makes use of
control surfaces. These turning vanes also serve as an anchor for the
synthetic vortex, locking it into a small region. An abstract concept of
the turning vane geometry is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cartoon_vanes}.

  \begin{figure}[!htb]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics[width = 8 cm]{figs/ground_vanes}
     \caption{Image of a possible two tier turning vane 
       configuration for generating synthetic dust devils. This image depicts a 
       vertical slice through the proposed configuration, and does not show the reflection 
       of the two tier turning vanes, which would be expected to encircle the dust devil core.}
     \label{fig:cartoon_vanes}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

% Our observations of the naturally occuring dust devils informs some of
% our \textit{a priori} expectations for the design of the turning
% vanes. The bottom tier are designed to reside in the lower region, where
% the principle inflow will occur. We therefore expect a radial or nearly
% radial start to the vanes, which becomes increasingly tangential as the
% flow moves towards the center. The inner radius of the bottom tier will
% correspond to the outer radius of the generated vortex. 

% The top tier serves a different purpose. We expect a non-zero initial
% angle, as this tier is also designed to protect the rising vortex from
% being blow away by ambient winds. The vanes radius will be shorter, as
% the flow from this tier becomes entrained and the vortex grows in
% size. 

% For both the upper and lower tiers, our objective is to strike a balance
% between effectively turning the incoming flow to impart azimuthal
% velocity, while simultaneously not introducing such a high angle that
% the vanes act as a blocking surface which the incoming flow will move
% around. For instance, when the inlet angles are too severe, the vanes
% block the incoming flow, which results in an adverse pressure gradient
% existing near the outside edge of the 
% vanes. This serves to force fluid around and over the system, instead
% of inside the turning vanes. This reduces the velocity of flow inside
% the system, resulting in a weaker thermal vortex.  To reduce
% the flow blockage, we use gently curving vanes. A gentler angle permits
% more flow to enter the vane region, after which the curvature increases
% toward the center of the vanes. In this way, the angle smoothly varies
% between a nearly zero angle at the outside edge of the vanes to a
% maximum angle at a specified inner radius.

The characteristics of natural dust devils shown in Figure
\ref{fig:cartoon} suggest that the turning vanes be structured with two
tiers (see Figure \ref{fig:cartoon_vanes}). The lower tier would be
designed to manipulate the surface layer 
that lifts up into the core of the vortex, while the upper tier would
control entrainment into the vortex. In both tiers, the design of the
turning vanes must balance between the need to turn the flow from the
radial direction to the azimuthal direction to create vortical motion
and the requirement to not block flow into the vortex. Furthermore, in
the presence of a cross wind, the vanes need to prevent flow that
would pass right through the device, which would disrupt the vortex.
Finally, in field tests of design concepts for a solar vortex device
conducted by our colleagues at the Georgia Tech, it was found that cross
winds over the facility will also disrupt the vortical flow, and that
this could be controlled by introducing a conical wind-block on top of
the upper tier of vanes. One such field test configuration is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:field_test}. Within this broad conceptual design, there
remains a large design space to explore, including design parameters for
both tiers of vanes and the wind-block cone.

  \begin{figure}[!htb]

     \includegraphics[width = 8 cm]{figs/sov_field}
     \caption{An image of the field configuration from the June, 2015
     tests in Arizona. The second (upper) tier of vanes and the cone are
     clearly visible. This apparatus has an outer diameter of
     approximately six meters.}
     \label{fig:field_test}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

To extract energy from the synthetic dust devil formed by the vane
system described briefly above, a turbine would be placed near the top
of the upper vanes. The turbine would extract energy from both the
vertical and azimuthal flow in the vortex, and so the design
considerations are different from those for a classical wind turbine.
Furthermore, there is presumably an analog to the Betz limit on how
much of the energy can be extracted, without disrupting the flow so
much that the vortex cannot be maintained. This is explored as part of
the turbine design process in Section~\ref{subsec:field_predict}. 

In the research conducted here, the design and performance of a dust
devil energy harvesting system are explored using computational
models. Computer models enable a more extensive exploration of
the design space than would be possible experimentally. The design
concept described above are analyzed to maximize the the
power that can be generated by the system and to develop scaling
describing how power depends on device size, wind speed and thermal
conditions. This has resulted in new design concepts that were also 
evaluated. The subsequent chapter will provide the mathematical
representation used to model the system.

% Our principle objective is to use a synthetic dust devil to produce

% devil, a turbine is placed 
% at or near the top of the second tier of turning vanes. 
% The blades of the turbine will be driven by the dust devil's azimuthal

% expectation of the efficiency with which energy can be expected to be

% turbine on the dust devil's vortex, and any potential disruption of the
% flow on account of the turbine must be investigated. Optimizing the

\section{Previous Concepts for Extracting Gravitational Potential
 Energy}

This is not the first attempt to harness ambient gravitational potential
energy. Rather, a plethora of concepts have been attempted over many
years to generate work from solar energy. 
%Solar chimney. vertical wind mill
%
%
% in fact,
%

Some of the earliest designs for vertical windmills and steam jacks date
back to Roman times\cite{hills1996power}. Even Leonardo da Vinci
sketched a chimney with a turbine at the top with four vanes\cite{?}.  
%for instance steam jack, driven by steam, the smoke jack, driven by hot
%gas rising from the fire are driven by similar principles. 

%
% solar updraft tower
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_updraft_tower
%
Modern concepts have been more sophisticated. For instance, Solar
updraft towers are envisioned to extract energy from convective hot air
updrafts in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow drives wind
turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to
produce electricity. A disadvantage of this technology is the
substantial size necessary to produce non-trivial amounts of energy. 
%
% typical solar updraft towers
%
Consider Spain's Manzanares solar chimney, which possessed a 200 meter
tall chimney, with a diameter of ten meters. This device collected solar
resource over 250 meters, and had a heat to work conversion efficiency
of 0.2\%\cite{?}. The high cost and complexity of building structures
this tall greatly limit the feasibility of the venture. 
%
% vortex engine
%
These concepts differed greatly from the present work, perhaps most
notably due to the lack of substantial rotation. A design much closer to
the SoV is that of the ``Vortex
Engine''~\cite{vortex_engine,michaud2006atmospheric}. Here, a vortex is
created by admitting warm or humid air tangentially into the base of
a circular wall. The project differs in that the heat source in this
case has been targeted at waste industrial heat, but the core
thermodynamic principle is similar. 

Nevertheless, none of these concepts are identical to this work. In
particular, none attempt to harness external winds, nor have any so
directly turned to the naturally occurring dust devil physics to inform
the design of the apparatus.
