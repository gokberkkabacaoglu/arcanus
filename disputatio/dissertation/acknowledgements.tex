While only one author is listed, a document of this magnitude
necessarily builds and relies upon the assistance of others. 
%This is stated perhaps most eloquently by Sir Isaac Newton, FRS, ``If I
%have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of
%giants.''

I am deeply indebted to Fatima Bridgewater, Amy Harding, and Tara
Upchurch for always conjuring ways to sneak me into Prof. Moser's
schedule, often on particularly short notice.

I wish to thank the entire PECOS center over the many years it has
existed. I've learned something from everyone in the group, as well as
many friendships I hope will last a lifetime. Chris, Karl, Marco, MK,
Paul, Rhys, Roy, Todd-- thank you. I'm particularly indebted to Damon and
David for graciously providing comments on chapters.

% % SUPERVISORS
% % -----------
% I would like to thank my advisor, Dr\@. Robert D\@. Moser, for the
% unwavering support, warm guidance, and considerable latitude he granted
% me throughout my doctoral studies.  I appreciate my committees' patience
% and input.  In particular, I would like to thank Dr\@. Todd A\@. Oliver
% for the years upon years he spent answering five minute questions that
% often turned into hour-long discussions.

% % ACADEMICS
% % ---------
% This thesis would not have happened without Dr\@. Victor Topalian's
% willingness to help me apply his spatiotemporal homogenization approach
% for which I am grateful.  Equally important to the research were the Orion
% Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle solutions provided by Dr\@. Paul T\@. Bauman
% building atop work by Drs\@. Roy H\@. Stogner and Benjamin S\@. Kirk.
% Perspectives I learned from collaborating with Dr\@. Oleg Schilling
% during two summers spent at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
% greatly aided me.  He also graciously reviewed drafts of this document.
% %
% I owe much to Drs\@. Christopher S\@. Simmons and Karl W\@. Schulz for
% software-related discussions and, along with the Sysnet group at the
% Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, for the exceptional
% computational and project infrastructure they provided.

% % COLLEAGUES
% % ----------
% Thanks are extended to Dr\@. Jesse Chan, Dr\@. Henry Chang, Truman E\@. Ellis,
% Myoungkyu Lee, Nicholas Malaya, and Dr\@. Nathan Roberts for many useful fluid
% mechanics discussions of the sort too embarrassing to ask one's advisor.
% Rebecca Morrison and Dr\@. Thomas Kirschenmann helped with similar probability
% and statistics questions.  Dr\@.  Kemelli C\@. Estacio-Hiroms assisted with the
% concepts behind the manufactured solution presented in the appendix and Dr\@.
% Shan Yang showed how to accommodate the associated manufactured forcing within
% the semi-implicit temporal scheme.  Dr\@.  Jesse Windle made several excellent
% suggestions regarding the autoregressive uncertainty estimation technique.
% Dr\@. Damon McDougall kindly answered many Matplotlib questions.  Thank you to
% Nicholas, Damon, and Dr\@. Craig Michoski for reviewing thesis drafts.  I
% appreciate just how often Myoungkyu, Thomas, Rebecca, Dr\@. Michael Borden and
% Dr\@. Omar Al Hinai asked me to go grab lunch and how easily they could be
% talked into it themselves.

% % FAMILY
% % ------
% My family has been incredibly supportive throughout this journey.
