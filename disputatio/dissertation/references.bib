    abstract = { Abstract The paper describes the characteristics of a convective plume and a dust devil from measurements made at 5.66 and 22.6 m above a flat uniform site in Kansas. The velocity fluctuations were measured with a continuous-wave, three-component sonic anemometer and the temperature fluctuations with a fine platinum wire thermometer. The data show that the plume is basically a non-rotating system; it is more tilted in the downwind direction than the dust devil, travels at a lower velocity than the mean wind speed at 0.5 m, and requires vertical stretching for its maintenance in the presence of wind shear. The dust devil shows a down-draft in the middle, travels at a higher velocity than the mean wind at 32 m, and derives much of its stability from rotation. Both systems tend to transport momentum upward, against the velocity gradient, which probably accounts for the very low and sometimes negative stresses observed during unstable conditions. }

An error analysis is performed for the case in which both the velocity and pressure are approximated by \{C0\} interpolations. Combinations of \{C0\} interpolations which are unstable according to the Babuška-Brezzi condition (e.g., equal-order interpolations) are shown to be stable and convergent within the present framework. Calculations exhibiting the good behavior of the methodology are presented. "

abstract = "Computation of compressible flows at low Mach number is often performed by modifications of compressible flow solvers to the low Mach number limit. In particular, time stepping schemes are used where a Poisson problem is solved for pressure updates. In this paper, we propose a different approach for fast computation of stationary solutions. The discretization is made by bilinear and biquadratic finite elements with an elaborated stabilization. It allows the analytical construction of the Jacobian for the whole coupled system. It is used in Newton iterations for solving the nonlinear problems. No time stepping is needed for a wide class of stationary problems. Numerical computations of a benchmark problem for natural convection show the accuracy of the presented method. Different kinds of discretization are compared quantitatively. Furthermore, the aspect of local mesh refinement is addressed. The local refinement is controled by measuring the discretization error of the sought quantity by a posteriori error estimates. This concept is based on solving an adjoint problem which enters in the error estimator as weighting factors of local residuals. "

volume="119",
number="3",
pages="431--447",
abstract="This historical survey shows that Obukhov's 1946 fundamental paper on a universal length scale for exchange processes in the surface layer was the basis for the derivation of the similarity theory by Monin and Obukhov in 1954. A brief overview of the experiments and findings used to formulate the universal functions in the presently used form is given. Finally, the current status of the theory is described, covering topics such as the accuracy of the universal functions and the turbulent Prandtl number.",
