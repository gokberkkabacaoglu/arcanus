flow model, a radiative heat transfer model, and a surface ablation model to
study the surface heat transfer and surface ablation rate of atmospheric

Observations on the challenges of the loose-coupling strategy are given.
Representative results are presented for two-dimensional benchmark examples and
for three-dimensional flow at an angle of attack past a symmetric capsule based
on the Crew Exploration Vehicle reentry vehicle. Effects due to the interaction
with radiation and ablation are shown for two quantities of interest: the
predicted peak surface heat flux and the ablation rate on the vehicle heat
shield. Uncertain parameters are identified in each of the submodels, and a
preliminary parameter sensitivity study is carried out by varying these values
to examine their effects on the heat transfer and ablation rates in the coupled
problem.},

A time-varying manufactured solution is presented for the compressible

Newtonian perfect gas obeying a power law viscosity.  The solution is built
from waveforms with adjustable phase offsets and mixed partial derivatives to
thoroughly exercise all the terms in the equations.  Temperature, rather
than pressure, is selected to have a simple analytic form to aid verifying
codes having temperature-based boundary conditions.  In order to alleviate the
combinatorial complexity of finding a symbolic expression for the complete
forcing terms, a hybrid approach combining the open source symbolic
manipulation library SymPy with floating point computations is employed.  A C++
implementation of the resulting manufactured solution and the forcing terms are
provided.  Tests ensure the floating point implementation matches the solution
to relative errors near machine epsilon.  The manufactured solution was used to
verify a new three-dimensional, pseudo-spectral channel code.  A verification
test for the flat plate geometry is also included.  This hybrid manufactured
solution generation approach can be extended to either more complicated
constitutive relations or multi-species flows.

large-scale motions, and the latter to the scaling of the pressure itself. It
is also found that the pressure terms scale better near the wall when they are
not separated into their diffusion and deviatoric components, but mostly only
because the two terms tend to cancel each other in the viscous sublayer. The

of the relatively low Reynolds number, all of the relevant scales of motion can
be captured, and no subgrid-scale or turbulence model is needed. The isothermal
boundary conditions give rise to a flow that is strongly influenced by
wall-normal gradients of mean density and temperature. These gradients are
found to cause an enhanced streamwise coherence of the near-wall streaks, but
not to seriously invalidate Morkovin's hypothesis : the magnitude of
fluctuations of total temperature and especially pressure are much less than
their mean values, and consequently the dominant compressibility effect is that
due to mean property variations. The Van Driest transformation is found to be
very successful at both Mach numbers, and when properly scaled, statistics are

turbulent inflow data for simulations of complex spatially developing boundary

velocity data from an auxiliary simulation of a zero pressure gradient boundary
layer. The auxiliary simulation is also spatially developing, but generates its
own inflow conditions through a sequence of operations where the velocity field
at a downstream station is rescaled and re-introduced at the inlet. This
procedure is essentially a variant of the Spalart method, optimized so that an
existing inflow–outflow code can be converted to an inflow-generation device
through the addition of one simple subroutine. The proposed method is shown to
produce a realistic turbulent boundary layer which yields statistics that are
in good agreement with both experimental data and results from direct
simulations. The method is used to provide inflow conditions for a large eddy
simulation ({LES}) of a spatially evolving boundary layer spanning a momentum
thickness Reynolds number interval of 1530–2150. The results from the {LES}
calculation are compared with those from other simulations that make use of
more approximate inflow conditions. When compared with the approximate inflow
generation techniques, the proposed method is shown to be highly accurate, with
little or no adjustment of the solution near the inlet boundary. In contrast,
the other methods surveyed produce a transient near the inlet that persists
several boundary layer thicknesses downstream. Lack of a transient when using
the proposed method is significant since the adverse effects of inflow errors
are typically minimized through a costly upstream elongation of the mesh.
Extension of the method for non-zero pressure gradients is also discussed.},

@techreport{Coleman2010Primer,
    abstract = {Direct Numerical Simulation ({DNS}) is the branch of {CFD}
devoted to high-fidelity solution of turbulent flows. {DNS} differs from
conventional {CFD} in that the turbulence is explicitly resolved, rather than
modelled by a Reynolds-averaged {Navier-Stokes} ({RANS}) closure. It differs
from large-eddy simulation ({LES}) in that all scales, including the very
smallest ones, are captured, removing the need for a subgrid-scale model. {DNS}
can thus be viewed as a numerical experiment producing a series of
non-empirical solutions, from first principles, for a virtual turbulent flow
(see Figure 1). Its great strength is the ability to provide complete
knowledge, unaffected by approximations, at all points within the flow, at all
times within the simulation period. {DNS} is therefore ideal for addressing
basic research questions regarding turbulence physics and modelling. This
ability, however, comes at a high price, which prevents {DNS} from being used
as a general-purpose design tool. The defining characteristics of {DNS} stem
from the distinctive characteristics of turbulence. Because turbulence is
inherently unsteady and three-dimensional, {DNS} requires timedependent
calculations within a three-dimensional domain.? These two features are shared
with {LES} (and therefore {LES}/{RANS} hybrid strategies such as detached eddy
simulation ({DES})). The unique feature of {DNS} is associated with the manner
in which turbulence is affected by viscosity. This is responsible for the two
chief drawbacks of {DNS} are its extreme computational cost, and severe
limitation on the maximum Reynolds number that can be considered.},

a two-dimensional turbulent boundary layer which has been investigated by
measuring the time-dependent vorticity flux at the wall, vorticity vector,
strain-rate tensor and dissipation-rate tensor in the near-wall region with
spatial resolution of the order of 7 Kolmogorov viscous length scales.
Considerations of the structure function of velocity and pressure, which
constitute vorticity flux and vorticity, indicated that, in the limit of
vanishing distance, the maximum attainable content of these quantities which
corresponds to unrestricted resolution, is determined by Taylor's microscale.
They also indicated that most of the contributions to vorticity or vorticity
flux come from the uncorrelated part of the two signals involved. The
measurements allowed the computation of all components of the vorticity
stretching vector, which indicates the rate of change of vorticity on a
Lagrangian reference frame if viscous effects are negligible, and several
matrix invariants of the velocity gradient or strain-rate tensor and terms
appearing in the transport equations of vorticity, strain rate and their
squared fluctuations. The orientation of vorticity revealed several
preferential directions. During bursts or sweeps vorticity is inclined at 35°
to the longitudinal direction. It was also found that there is high probability
of the vorticity vector aligning with the direction of the intermediate
extensive strain corresponding to the middle eigenvector of the strain-rate
matrix. The results of the joint probability distributions of the vorticity
vector orientation angles showed that these angles may be related to those of
hairpin vortex structures. All invariants considered exhibit a very strong
intermittent behaviour which is characterized by large-amplitude bursts which
may be of the order of 10 r.m.s. values. Small-scale motions dominated by high
rates of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and high enstrophy density are of
particular interest. It appears that the fluctuating strain field dominates the
fluctuations of pressure more than enstrophy. Local high values of the
invariants are also often associated with peaks in the shear stress.},

@phdthesis{Orlu2009,
    abstract = {This thesis deals with the description and development of two
classical turbulent shear flows, namely free jet and flat plate turbulent
boundary layer flows. In both cases new experimental data has been obtained and
in the latter case comparisons are also made with data obtained from data
bases, both of experimental and numerical origin. The jet flow studies comprise
three parts, made in three different experimental facilities, each dealing with
a specific aspect of jet flows. The first part is devoted to the effect of
swirl on the mixing characteristics of a passive scalar in the near-field
region of a moderately swirling jet. Instantaneous streamwise and azimuthal
velocity components as well as the temperature were simultaneously accessed by
means of combined X-wire and cold-wire anemometry. The results indicate a
modification of the turbulence structures to that effect that the swirling jet
spreads, mixes and evolves faster compared to its non-swirling counterpart. The
high correlation between streamwise velocity and temperature fluctuations as
well as the streamwise passive scalar flux are even more enhanced due to the
addition of swirl, which in turn shortens the distance and hence time needed to
mix the jet with the ambient air. The second jet flow part was set out to test
the hypothesis put forward by Talamelli \& Gavarini (Flow, Turbul. \& Combust.
76), who proposed that the wake behind a separation wall between two streams of
a coaxial jet creates the condition for an absolute instability. The
experiments confirm the hypothesis and show that the instability, by means of
the induced vortex shedding, provides a continuous forcing mechanism for the
control of the flow field. The potential of this passive mechanism as an easy,
effective and practical way to control the near-field of interacting shear
layers as well as its effect towards increased turbulence activity has been
shown. The third part of the jet flow studies deals with the hypothesis that so
called oblique transition may play a role in the breakdown to turbulence for an
axisymmetric {jet.For} wall bounded flows oblique transition gives rise to
steady streamwise streaks that break down to turbulence, as for instance
documented by Elofsson \& Alfredsson (J. Fluid Mech. 358). The scenario of
oblique transition has so far not been considered for jet flows and the aim was
to study the effect of two oblique modes on the transition scenario as well as
on the flow dynamics. For certain frequencies the turbulence intensity was
surprisingly found to be reduced, however it was not possible to detect the
presence of streamwise streaks. This aspect must be furher investigated in the
future in order to understand the connection between the turbulence reduction
and the azimuthal forcing. The boundary layer part of the thesis is also
threefold, and uses both new data as well as data from various data bases to
investigate the effect of certain limitations of hot-wire measurements near the
wall on the mean velocity but also on the fluctuating streamwise velocity
component. In the first part a new set of experimental data from a zero
pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer, supplemented by direct and
independent skin friction measurements, are presented. The Reynolds number
range of the data is between 2300 and 18700 when based on the free stream
velocity and the momentum loss thickness. Data both for the mean and
fluctuating streamwise velocity component are presented. The data are validated
against the composite profile by Chauhan et al. (Fluid Dyn. Res. 41) and are
found to fulfil recently established equilibrium criteria. The problem of
accurately locating the wall position of a hot-wire probe and the errors this
can result in is thoroughly discussed in part 2 of the boundary layer study. It
is shown that the expanded law of the wall to forth and fifth order with
calibration constants determined from recent high Reynolds number {DNS} can be
used to fix the wall position to an accuracy of 0.1 and 0.25 l\_ * (l\_* is the
viscous length scale) when accurately determined measurements reaching y+=5 and
10, respectively, are available. In the absence of data below the above given
limits, commonly employed analytical functions and their log law constants,
have been found to affect the determination of wall position to a high
degree. It has been shown, that near-wall measurements below y+=10 or
preferable 5 are essential in order to ensure a correctly measured or deduced
absolute wall position. A  number of peculiarities in concurrent wall-bounded
turbulent flow studies, was found to be associated with a erroneously deduced
wall position. The effect of poor spatial resolution using hot-wire anemometry
on the measurements of the streamwise velocity is dealt with in the last part.
The viscous scaled hot-wire length, L+, has been found to exert a strong impact
on the probability density distribution (pdf) of the streamwise velocity, and
hence its higher order moments, over the entire buffer region and also the
lower region of the log region. For varying Reynolds numbers spatial resolution
effects act against the trend imposed by the Reynolds number. A systematic
reduction of the mean velocity with increasing L+ over the entire classical
buffer region and beyond has been found. A reduction of around 0.3 uƬ, where uƬ
is the friction velocity, has been deduced for L+=60 compared to L+=15.
Neglecting this effect can lead to a seemingly Reynolds number dependent
buffer or log region. This should be taken into consideration, for instance, in
the debate, regarding the prevailing influence of viscosity above the buffer
region at high Reynolds numbers. We also conclude that the debate concerning
the universality of the pdf within the overlap region has been artificially
complicated due to the ignorance of spatial resolution effects beyond the
classical buffer region on the velocity fluctuations.},

    abstract = {The interaction between an initially laminar boundary layer
developing spatially on a flat plate and wakes traversing the inlet
periodically has been simulated numerically. The three-dimensional,
time-dependent Navier--Stokes equations were solved with
$5.24\otimes{}10^7$ grid points using a message passing interface on a scalable
parallel computer. The flow bears a close resemblance to the transitional
boundary layer on turbomachinery blades and was designed following, in outline,
the experiments by Liu \& Rodi (1991). The momentum thickness Reynolds number
evolves from $\mbox{Re}_\theta$ = 80 to 1120. Mean and second-order statistics
downstream of $\mbox{Re}_\theta$ = 800 are of canonical flat-plate turbulent boundary
layers and are in good agreement with Spalart (1988). In many important
aspects the mechanism leading to the inception of turbulence is in agreement
with previous fundamental studies on boundary layer bypass transition, as
summarized in Alfredsson \& Matsubara (1996). Inlet wake disturbances inside
the boundary layer evolve rapidly into longitudinal puffs during an initial
receptivity phase. In the absence of strong forcing from free-stream vortices,
these structures exhibit streamwise elongation with gradual decay in amplitude.
Selective intensification of the puffs occurs when certain types of turbulent
eddies from the free-stream wake interact with the boundary layer flow through
a localized instability. Breakdown of the puffs into young turbulent spots is
preceded by a wavy motion in the velocity field in the outer part of the
boundary {layer.Properties} and streamwise evolution of the turbulent spots
following breakdown, as well as the process of completion of transition to
turbulence, are in agreement with previous engineering turbomachinery flow
studies. The overall geometrical characteristics of the matured turbulent spot
are in good agreement with those observed in the experiments of Zhong et al.
(1998). When breakdown occurs in the outer layer, where local convection speed
is large, as in the present case, the spots broaden downstream, having the
vague appearance of an arrowhead pointing {upstream.The} flow has also been
studied statistically. Phase-averaged velocity fields and skin-friction
coefficients in the transitional region show similar features to previous
cascade experiments. Selected results from additional thought experiments and
simulations are also presented to illustrate the effects of streamwise pressure

@article{Oliver2012Accounting,
    abstract = {When assessing the veracity of mathematical models, it is
important to consider the uncertainties in the data used for the assessment. In
this paper, we study the impact of data uncertainties on the analysis of
overlap layer models for the mean velocity in wall-bounded turbulent flows.
Specifically, the tools of Bayesian statistics are used to calibrate and
compare six competing models of the mean velocity profile, including multiple
logarithmic and power law forms, using velocity profile measurements from a
zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer and fully developed turbulent
pipe flow. The calibration problem is formulated as a Bayesian update of the
joint probability density function for the calibration parameters, which are
treated as random variables to characterize incomplete knowledge about their
values. This probabilistic formulation provides a natural treatment of
uncertainty and gives insight into the quality of the fit, features that are
not easily obtained in deterministic calibration procedures. The model
comparison also relies on a Bayesian update. In particular, the relative
probabilities of the competing models are updated using the calibration data.
The resulting posterior probabilities quantify the relative plausibility of the
competing models given the data. For the boundary layer, results are shown for
five subsets of the turbulent boundary layer data due to \"{O}sterlund,
including different Reynolds number and wall distance ranges, and multiple
assumptions regarding the magnitude of the uncertainty in the velocity
measurements. For most choices, multiple models have relatively high posterior
probability, indicating that it is difficult to distinguish between the models.
For the most inclusive data sets—i.e., the largest ranges of Reynolds number
and wall distance—the first-order logarithmic law due to Buschmann and
{Gad-el-Hak} is significantly more probable, given the data, than the other
models evaluated. For the pipe flow, data from the Princeton Superpipe is
analyzed for the region where {McKeon} et al. find a logarithmic layer (600 ⩽
y+ ⩽ 0.12δ+). As in the boundary layer case, the first-order logarithmic law by
Buschmann and {Gad-el-Hak} is most probable. However, the parameter values
required to fit the data are different from those necessary for the boundary
layer. Thus, the present analysis confirms the differences between the boundary
layer and pipe flow results observed elsewhere in the literature, casting
serious doubt on the universality of overlap layer model parameters.},

however, to within experimental uncertainty, the skin-friction and
heat-transfer measurements were in agreement with the laminar theory of van
Driest (1952). For predicting turbulent skin-friction coefficient, it was
established that, for the range of Mach numbers and Reynolds numbers of the
experiments, with cold walls and boundary layers approaching the turbulent
equilibrium state, the Spalding \& Chi (1964) method was the most suitable of
the theories tested. It was also established that if the heat transfer rate to
the wall is to be predicted, then the Spalding \& Chi (1964) method should be
used in conjunction with a Reynolds analogy factor near unity. If more accurate
results are required, then an experimentally observed relationship between the

The local strain-rate distortion parameters for the square roughness pattern
were small (~ -0.01), and the mean and turbulent flow properties followed the
canonical rough-wall boundary-layer trends. The diamond-shaped roughness
topology produced a pattern of attached oblique shocks and expansion waves that
led to strong distortion parameters. The distortions varied from -0.3 to 0.4
across the roughness elements, which resulted in localized extra turbulence
production that generated large periodic variations in the turbulence levels
across individual roughness elements that spanned the boundary-layer thickness;
for example, the Reynolds shear stress varied by ~100\%. This result
demonstrated a mechanism for altering the turbulence in supersonic boundary
layers.}

gradients. Local surface topologies included k-type diamond and d-type square
elements; a smooth wall was examined for comparison purposes. Three global
distortions were studied with each of the three surface topologies.
Measurements included planar contours of the mean and fluctuating velocity via
particle image velocimetry, Pitot pressure profiles, pressure sensitive paint

resolution to characterize the mean and turbulent flow structure and to examine
interactions between the local surface roughness distortions and the imposed
pressure gradients on the turbulence production. A strong response to both the
local and global distortions was observed with the diamond elements, where the
effect of the elements extended into the outer regions of the boundary layer.
It was shown that the primary cause for the observed response was the result of
local shock and expansion waves modifying the turbulence structure and
production. By contrast, the square elements showed a less pronounced response
to local flow distortions as the waves were significantly weaker. However, the
frictional losses were higher for the blunter square roughness elements.

@article{Roy2006Review,
    abstract = {Accurate aerodynamic prediction is critical for the design and
optimization of hypersonic vehicles. Turbulence modeling remains a major source
of uncertainty in the computational prediction of aerodynamic forces and
heating for these systems. The first goal of this article is to update the
previous comprehensive review of hypersonic shock/turbulent boundary-layer
interaction experiments published in 1991 by Settles and Dodson (Hypersonic
shock/boundary-layer interaction database. {NASA} {CR} 177577, 1991). In their
review, Settles and Dodson developed a methodology for assessing experiments
appropriate for turbulence model validation and critically surveyed the
existing hypersonic experiments. We limit the scope of our current effort by
considering only two-dimensional ({2D})/axisymmetric flows in the hypersonic
flow regime where calorically perfect gas models are appropriate. We extend the
prior database of recommended hypersonic experiments (on four {2D} and two {3D}
shock-interaction geometries) by adding three new geometries. The first two
geometries, the flat plate/cylinder and the sharp cone, are canonical,
zero-pressure gradient flows which are amenable to theory-based correlations,
and these correlations are discussed in detail. The third geometry added is the
{2D} shock impinging on a turbulent flat plate boundary layer. The current {2D}
hypersonic database for shock-interaction flows thus consists of nine
experiments on five different geometries. The second goal of this study is to
review and assess the validation usage of various turbulence models on the
existing experimental database. Here we limit the scope to one- and
two-equation turbulence models where integration to the wall is used (i.e., we
omit studies involving wall functions). A methodology for validating turbulence
models is given, followed by an extensive evaluation of the turbulence models
on the current hypersonic experimental database. A total of 18 one- and
two-equation turbulence models are reviewed, and results of turbulence model
assessments for the six models that have been extensively applied to the
hypersonic validation database are compiled and presented in graphical form.
While some of the turbulence models do provide reasonable predictions for the
surface pressure, the predictions for surface heat flux are generally poor, and
often in error by a factor of four or more. In the vast majority of the
turbulence model validation studies we review, the authors fail to adequately
address the numerical accuracy of the simulations (i.e., discretization and
iterative error) and the sensitivities of the model predictions to freestream
turbulence quantities or near-wall y+ mesh spacing. We recommend new hypersonic
experiments be conducted which (1) measure not only surface quantities but also
mean and fluctuating quantities in the interaction region and (2) provide
careful estimates of both random experimental uncertainties and correlated bias
errors for the measured quantities and freestream conditions. For the
turbulence models, we recommend that a wide-range of turbulence models
(including newer models) be re-examined on the current hypersonic experimental
database, including the more recent experiments. Any future turbulence model
validation efforts should carefully assess the numerical accuracy and model
sensitivities. In addition, model corrections (e.g., compressibility
corrections) should be carefully examined for their effects on a standard,
low-speed validation database. Finally, as new experiments or direct numerical
simulation data become available with information on mean and fluctuating
quantities, they should be used to improve the turbulence models and thus
increase their predictive capability.},

compressible turbulent shear flows. The work is based on direct numerical
simulation ({DNS}) of two supersonic fully developed channel flows between very
cold isothermal walls. Detailed decomposition and analysis of terms appearing
in the mean momentum and energy equations are presented. The simulation results
are used to provide insights into differences between conventional Reynolds and
Favre averaging of the mean-flow and turbulent quantities. Study of the
turbulence energy budget for the two cases shows that compressibility effects
due to turbulent density and pressure fluctuations are insignificant. In
particular, the dilatational dissipation and the mean product of the pressure
and dilatation fluctuations are very small, contrary to the results of
simulations for sheared homogeneous compressible turbulence and to recent
proposals for models for general compressible turbulent flows. This provides a
possible explanation of why the Van Driest density-weighted transformation
(which ignores any true turbulent compressibility effects) is so successful in
correlating compressible boundary-layer data. Finally, it is found that the
{DNS} data do not support the strong Reynolds analogy. A more general
representation of the analogy is analysed and shown to match the {DNS} data
very well.},

velocity fluctuations correlated with upstream shock motions. These results are
consistent with a simple model wherein a fuller velocity profile provides
increased resistance to separation and hence a downstream shock location, and

towards recovery by the most downstream measurements, the turbulence structure
remains far from equilibrium. Comparisons of computed (method of
characteristics) and measured velocity profiles indicate that the
post-expansion flow evolution is largely inviscid for approximately 10\^{I}´.
Turbulence levels decrease across the expansion, and the reductions increase in
severity as the wall is approached. Downstream of the 14\^{A}° expansions, the
reductions are more severe and reverse transition is indicated by sharp
reductions in turbulent kinetic energy levels and a change in sign of the
Reynolds shear stress. Dimensionless parameters such as anisotropy and shear
stress correlation coefficient highlight the complex evolution of the
post-expansion boundary layer. An examination of the compressible vorticity
transport equation and estimates of the perturbation impulses attributable to
streamline curvature, acceleration, and dilatation both confirm dilatation to
be the primary stabilizer. However, the dilatation impulse increases only
slightly for the 14\^{A}° expansions, so the dramatic differences downstream of
the 7\^{A}° and 14\^{A}° expansions indicate nonlinear boundary layer response.
Differences attributable to the varied radii of surface curvature are fleeting
for the 7\^{A}° expansions, but persist through the spatial extent of the
measurements for the 14\^{A}° expansions.},

@article{Oliver2014Estimating,
    abstract = {Rigorous assessment of uncertainty is crucial to the utility of
        direct numerical simulation ({DNS}) results. Uncertainties in the
            computed statistics arise from two sources: finite statistical
            sampling and the discretization of the {Navier–Stokes} equations.
            Due to the presence of non-trivial sampling error, standard
            techniques for estimating discretization error (such as Richardson
                    extrapolation) fail or are unreliable. This work provides a
            systematic and unified approach for estimating these errors. First,
        a sampling error estimator that accounts for correlation in the input
            data is developed. Then, this sampling error estimate is used as
            part of a Bayesian extension of Richardson extrapolation in order to
            characterize the discretization error. These methods are tested
            using the Lorenz equations and are shown to perform well. These
            techniques are then used to investigate the sampling and
            discretization errors in the {DNS} of a wall-bounded turbulent flow
            at Re τ ≈ 180. Both small (L x /δ × L z /δ = 4π × 2π) and large (L x
                    /δ × L z /δ = 12π × 4π) domain sizes are investigated. For
            each case, a sequence of meshes was generated by first designing a
            ” nominal” mesh using standard heuristics for wall-bounded
            simulations. These nominal meshes were then coarsened to generate a
            sequence of grid resolutions appropriate for the Bayesian Richardson
            extrapolation method. In addition, the small box case is
            computationally inexpensive enough to allow simulation on a finer
            mesh, enabling the results of the extrapolation to be validated in a
            weak sense. For both cases, it is found that while the sampling
            uncertainty is large enough to make the order of accuracy difficult
            to determine, the estimated discretization errors are quite small.
            This indicates that the commonly used heuristics provide adequate
            resolution for this class of problems. However, it is also found
            that, for some quantities, the discretization error is not small
            relative to sampling error, indicating that the conventional wisdom
            that sampling error dominates discretization error for this class of
            simulations needs to be reevaluated.},

shown, by means of simulations, that the revised t tea is often conservative

level) when the equivalent sample size is known. However, in most practical
cases the equivalent sample size is not known. Then the test becomes liberal
(the actual significance level is greater than the specified significance

size is large (greater than approximately 30). The difficulties inherent in

order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With
this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves

periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection
of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating

Several methods are available to estimate an autoregressive model. Usually, the

generally yield comparable parameter estimates. In some special cases however,
involving nearly periodic signals, the {Yule-Walker} approach may lead to
incorrect parameter estimates. Burg's method offers the best alternative to
{Yule-Walker}. In this paper a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon is

the maximum likelihood method if data are missing. Maximum likelihood estimates
of moving average and of autoregressive moving average models are not very
useful with missingdata. Those models are found most accurately if they are
derived from the estimated parameters of an intermediate autoregressive model.
With statistical criteria for the selection of model order and model type, a
completely automatic and numerically reliable algorithm is developed that

because of the increase of the variance of the residual energy for higher model
orders that has not been accounted for in other criteria. Only the expectation
of the logarithm of the residual energy, as a function of the model order, has
been the basis for the previous classes of asymptotical and finite sample

    abstract = {Presently employed hypothesis tests for multivariate
geophysical data (e.g., climatic fields) require the assumption that either the
data are serially uncorrelated, or spatially uncorrelated, or both. Good
methods have been developed to deal with temporal correlation, but
generalization of these methods to multivariate problems involving spatial
correlation has been problematic, particularly when (as is often the case)
sample sizes are small relative to the dimension of the data vectors. Spatial
correlation has been handled successfully by resampling methods when the
temporal correlation can be neglected, at least according to the null
hypothesis. This paper describes the construction of resampling tests for
differences of means that account simultaneously for temporal and spatial
correlation. First, univariate tests are derived that respect temporal
correlation in the data, using the relatively new concept of ?moving blocks?
bootstrap resampling. These tests perform accurately for small samples and are
nearly as powerful as existing alternatives. Simultaneous application of these
univariate resampling tests to elements of data vectors (or fields) yields a
powerful (i.e., sensitive) multivariate test in which the cross correlation
between elements of the data vectors is successfully captured by the
resampling, rather than through explicit modeling and estimation.},

shear layers can be strongly affected by the application of extra rates of

strain rates include lateral divergence or convergence, and streamline
curvature in the plane of the mean shear. The changes in Reynolds stress are an
order of magnitude larger than would be expected from the explicit extra terms
in the Reynolds-stress transport equations, and therefore an order of magnitude
larger than predicted by conventional calculation methods. In the present
paper, one of a series on ``complex'' turbulent flows, we show that
bulk compression or dilatation (i.e. an extra strain rate div U) also appears
to affect turbulent shear layers, typical values of Reynolds stress being
increased by compression and decreased by dilatation. The fractional change in
Reynolds stress is an order of magnitude larger than the fractional change in
volume of a fluid element. The physical mechanism is probably analogous to that
responsible for the large effects of divergence or convergence in
incompressible flow. Because the phenomenon seems to be of great practical
importance we discuss it in the context of engineering calculation methods. An
empirical correction formula, analogous to those used to allow for divergence
or curvature effects, greatly reduces the large discrepancies found between
recent experiments on supersonic boundary layers and calculations by
conventional extensions of successful incompressible-flow methods.},

high-speed flight. Boundary layers developing along fuselage and wings of an
aircraft and along engine compressor and turbine blades are compressible and
mostly turbulent. The high-speed flow around rockets and through rocket nozzles
involves compressible turbulence and flow separation. Turbulent mixing and
combustion in scramjet engines is another example where compressibility
dominates the flow physics. Although compressible turbulent flows have
attracted researchers since the fifties of the last century, they are not
completely understood. Especially interactions between compressible turbulence
and combustion lead to challenging, yet unsolved problems. Direct numerical
simulation ({DNS}) and large-eddy simulation ({LES}) represent modern powerful
research tools which allow to mimic such flows in great detail and to analyze
underlying physical mechanisms, even those which cannot be accessed by the
experiment. The present lecture provides a short description of these tools and
some of their numerical characteristics. It then describes {DNS} and {LES}
results of fully-developed channel and pipe flow and highlights effects of
compressibility on the turbulence structure. The analysis of pressure
fluctuations in such flows with isothermal cooled walls leads to the conclusion
that the pressure-strain correlation tensor decreases in the wall layer and
that the turbulence anisotropy increases, since the mean density falls off
relative to the incompressible flow case. Similar increases in turbulence
anisotropy due to compressibility are observed in inert and reacting temporal
mixing layers. The nature of the pressure fluctuations is however two-facetted.
While inert compressible mixing layers reveal wave-propagation effects in the
pressure and density fluctuations, compressible reacting mixing layers seem to
generate pressure fluctuations that are controlled by the time-rate of change
of heat release and mean density variation as sources in the pressure Poisson
equation rather than wave propagation phenomena. This opens new challenges to
turbulence modellers and underlines the need to treat compressibility effects
via the full Reynolds stress equations.},

increased due to compressibility, while the shear stress component is slightly
reduced. Characteristic of the Reynolds stress transport is a suppression of

of a turbulent boundary layer over short regions of concave surface curvature.
Upstream of each curved wall, the free-stream Mach number was 2.87, and the
incoming boundary layer was typical of a two-dimensional,
zero-pressure-gradient, high-Reynolds-number flow. Two different curvatures
were used, with radii of curvature equal to 10 and 50 initial boundary-layer
thicknesses (Models I and II, respectively). The turning angle was 8\&deg; in
each case. As the boundary layer passed through the curved region, it
experienced a strong adverse pressure gradient, as well as the destabilizing
influences of bulk compression and concave curvature. Downstream of the curved
walls, the flow relaxed on a short plane wall. The mean and turbulent field for
each flow was investigated, using normal and inclined hot wires to measure the
turbulent fluctuations. Wherever possible, the results were compared with those
from a corresponding 8\&deg; ramp. The ramp and Model I exhibited a very
similar behaviour: turbulence levels increased significantly, and there was a
marked increase in structural parameters such as the stress ratio

Model II behaved quite differently: although the turbulence levels increased,
structural parameters were essentially unchanged. The similarities between the

total strains rather than local strains. In contrast, the flow in Model II is
sensitive to the local variations in the strain rate.},

that this change in heat-transfer rate is mainly due to an increase or decrease

providing measurements with which to develop and validate the tools used to
describe the shape change of ablating nosetips, transpiration cooling of
spherical nosetips, and the effects of roughness and blowing on the performance

patterned roughness surfaces constructed with grit roughness, and with
hemispherical and conical roughness elements respectively. Unique heat transfer

the average surface heat transfer and skin friction, and the detailed heating
over individual roughness elements. Unique models and instrumentation were also
developed to measure heat transfer and skin friction on both smooth and rough
surfaces with and in the absence of surface blowing. The measurements made in
these studies have been analyzed to provide data sets for code validation, and
correlations of roughness-induced heating enhancement in terms of roughness
height, shape, spacing, and blowing parameters. An analysis of the measurements
made in these studies brings into serious question the use of relationships
developed in water tunnel and low velocity airflows to relate the surface
characteristics of a rough surface to an equivalent sand-grain rough surface

reversion and discusses if there are any similarities or general
principles that govern them. In carrying out this examination, a
pragmatic definition of reversion is adopted, according to which a flow
has relaminarized if its development is understood without recourse to
any model for turbulent shear flow. This implies that the turbulent
fluctuations need not necessarily have completely vanished in the
relaminarized state; but that, if present, their contribution to mean
flow dynamics is negligible.  Under these circumstances, the flow may be
called quasi-laminar; it carries a residual turbulence that is inherited
from the previous history of the flow but has been rendered passive. The
chapter discusses three reverting flows. In the first, turbulent energy
is dissipated through the action of a molecular transport property,
such as the viscosity or conductivity, and the governing parameter is
typified by the Reynolds number. In the second class, turbulence energy
is destroyed or absorbed by work done against an external agency, such as
buoyancy forces or flow curvature; the typical parameter is a Richardson
number. The third class of reverting flows is exemplified by a turbulent
boundary layer subjected to severe acceleration.},

boundary layer and a matching inviscid (but rotational) outer layer. There is
consequently no entrainment to lowest order in \^{I}\^{a}1, and the boundary
layer thins down to conserve outer vorticity. In fact, the predictions of the
theory for the common measures of boundary-layer thickness are in excellent
agreement with experimental results, almost all the way from x0. On the other

presence of a short bubble-shaped reverse-transitional region on the wall,
where neither turbulent nor quasi-laminar calculations are valid. The random
velocity fluctuations inherited from the original turbulence decay with
distance, in the inner layer, according to inverse-power laws characteristic of
quasi-steady perturbations on a laminar flow. In the outer layer, there is

the location where K again falls below 3Ã10-6 and then rises back to unity.
Although Î³ is practically zero throughout the boundary layer in the vicinity

turbulent mixing. The mean velocity profile changes shape abruptly where K

l* the streak spacing (defined as average distance between low- and high-speed
streaks) increases from about 60l* in the turbulent boundary layer to 150-180l*
in the relaminarizing region. To process only the laminar part of the velocity
signals a filtering procedure based on a threshold value of the second
derivative of the time signals has been applied showing a slight increase in
the detected spanwise scales. Finally, measurements were carried out at an
enhanced level of free stream turbulence. Although small differences can be
observed, the results are qualitatively similar to the ones obtained at a low
level of free stream turbulence. This article was chosen from selected

gradient boundary layers are studied by carrying out an experiment using
laser-doppler anemometry over multiple traverses along a smooth plate. A set of
upstream conditions composed of upstream wind tunnel speed, tripwire location,
and the strength of the pressure gradient is analyzed. The similarity analysis
of the equations of motion for pressure gradient ï¬ows is used to obtain
the scales for the outer ï¬ow. For this study, the mean deï¬cit
proï¬les show a small dependence on the strength of the pressure gradient
when scaled with the freestream velocity U1 . Second, the upstream conditions
effects are removed from the velocity deï¬cit proï¬les when normalized
by the U1 = scaling. However, the Reynolds stress proï¬les show the effects
of upstream conditions and the strength of the pressure gradient. Finally,
these favorable pressure gradient ï¬ows are found to be nonequilibrium
ï¬ows because the pressure parameter is not constant. In addition, three
quadrants are found to describe all pressure gradient ï¬ows: one for
adverse pressure gradient, one for favorable pressure gradient, and one for
quasi-laminar ï¬ows, where different values are obtained and these are
dependent on the experimental conditions. The quadrants are obtained by

    abstract = {We report here the results of experiments on two flows
\^{a}ÂÂ one on a convex surface and the other on a flat surface
\^{a}ÂÂ designed to bring out explicitly the influence of streamwise
curvature on relaminarization in highly favourable pressure gradients. In both
flows, the initial conditions and the streamwise distribution of the Launder
pressure-gradient parameter \$K\$ are virtually identical. The maximum value of
\$K\$ is \$6.2\,{\times}\, 10^{-6}\$, well above the critical value of about
\$3.5\,{\times}\, 10^{-6}\$ usually advocated for relaminarization. The spatial
extent of the acceleration zone is of order 10 initial boundary-layer
thicknesses, appreciably shorter than in earlier work in order better to
simulate conditions at the leading edge of a typical aircraft wing. The fall in
skin friction coefficient is steeper and the rise in shape factor sharper on
the convex surface than on the flat surface, indicating that relaminarization
on the convex surface is both more rapid and more nearly complete. In the
crucial relaminarizing zone, two-layer quasi-laminar theory is found to predict
the convex-surface mean-flow parameters more accurately than the flat-surface
flow, without any explicit modelling of curvature effects. Thus, experimental
results and supporting calculations both indicate that the dominant effect of
streamwise convex curvature on the mean flow is to promote more rapid and
complete relaminarization in an accelerated turbulent boundary layer, thus
enhancing the probability of its occurrence on the leading edge of swept wings
where both factors are significantly in operation.},

linear contraction, yielding a peak value of the acceleration parameter of K =

boundary layer thicknesses. The relaminarization process is characterized by an
extensive series of mean flow and turbulence measurements obtained at several
representative streamwise locations. In anticipation of the loss of standard
log-law behaviour, the local wall shear stress is directly measured using the
oil-film interferometry technique. Mean flow measurements show a systematic
variation in the K\~{A}!`rm\~{A}!`n and additive constants with applied
streamwise strain rate. The series of measurements also indicate an apparent
decoupling of the outer and near-wall regions of the accelerating boundary
layer. In accord with this, conditional measurements show that fourth-quadrant
sweep events are virtually eliminated, while much less frequent but
larger-amplitude near-wall second-quadrant ejection events remain. The
reduction in fourth-quadrant sweep events is matched by an observed increase in
near-wall third-quadrant events. The consequent reduction in near-wall Reynolds
stress correlation and associated cross-stream momentum transport results in a
large reduction in cf for the relaminarized flow.},

@article{Cal2009Rough,
    abstract = {Laser Doppler anemometry measurements of the mean velocity and
Reynolds stresses are carried out for a rough-surface favourable pressure
gradient turbulent boundary layer. The experimental data is compared with
smooth favourable pressure gradient and rough zero-pressure gradient data. The
velocity and Reynolds stress profiles are normalized using various scalings
such as the friction velocity and free stream velocity. In the velocity
profiles, the effects of roughness are removed when using the friction
velocity. The effects of pressure gradient are not absorbed. When using the
free stream velocity, the scaling is more effective absorbing the pressure
gradient effects. However, the effects of roughness are almost removed, while
the effects of pressure gradient are still observed on the outer flow, when the
mean deficit velocity profiles are normalized by the U\^{a}ÂÂ
\^{I}Â´/\^{I}Â´ scaling. Furthermore, when scaled with U2\^{a}ÂÂ, the
u2 component of the Reynolds stress augments due to the rough surface despite
the imposed favourable pressure gradient; when using the friction velocity
scaling u2, it is dampened. It becomes \^{a}ÂÂflatter\^{a}ÂÂ in
the inner region mainly due to the rough surface, which destroys the coherent
structures of the flow and promotes isotropy. Similarly, the pressure gradient
imposed on the flow decreases the magnitude of the Reynolds stress profiles
especially on the v2 and -uv components for the u2 or U\^{a}ÂÂ2
scaling. These effects are reflected in the boundary layer parameter
\^{I}Â´/\^{I}Â´, which increase due to roughness, but decrease due to the
favourable pressure gradient. Additionally, the pressure parameter \^{I}Â
found not to be in equilibrium, describes the development of the turbulent
boundary layer, with no influence of the roughness linked to this parameter.
These measurements are the first with an extensive number of downstream
locations (11). This makes it possible to compute the required x-dependence for
the production term and the wall shear stress from the full integrated boundary
layer equation. The finding indicates that the skin friction coefficient
depends on the favourable pressure gradient condition and surface roughness.},

    abstract = {The mechanisms of laminarization in wall-bounded flows have
been investigated by performing direct numerical simulations ({DNS}) of
turbulent channel flows. By decreasing Reynolds numbers systematically, the
effects of the low Reynolds number are studied in connection with the near-wall
turbulent structure and turbulent statistics. At approximately the critical
Reynolds number, the turbulent skin friction is reduced, and the turbulent
structure changes qualitatively in the very near-wall region. Instantaneous
turbulent structures reveal that streamwise vortices, the cores of which are at
y+ ? 10, disappear, although low speed streaks and Reynolds shear stress are
still produced by larger streamwise vortices located in the buffer region y+

the center of a channel and also significantly deterred, which may heighten the
effects of the viscous sublayer over most of the channel section and suppress
the regeneration mechanisms of new streamwise vortices in the very near-wall
region. To investigate the details of how large-scale coherent vortices affect
the viscous sublayer and the relevant small-scale streamwise vortices, a body
force is virtually imposed in the wall-normal direction to enhance the large
streamwise vortices. As a result, it is found that when they are sufficiently
enhanced, the small-scale vortices reappear, and the sweep events are again
dominant in the viscous sublayer.},

    to identify and quantify the most important sources of uncertainty in

    design, and sizing based on inaccuracies in current knowledge of the
    parametric input modeling parameters. The resulting parametric modeling
    uncertainty would be combined with other uncertainty sources to determine
    the final aeroheating and {TPS} response modeling uncertainty for a
    given application, which can then be used to define appropriate
    margins and factors of safety that should be applied to the {TPS}. These
    techniques facilitate a risk-based probabilistic design approach, whereby
    the thermal protection system can be designed to a desired risk
    tolerance, and any remaining risk can be effectively compared to that of
    other subsystems via a system-level risk mitigation analysis. Modeling
    sensitivities, which are a byproduct of the uncertainty analysis, can be
    used to rank input uncertainty drivers. Key input uncertainties can then
    be prioritized and targeted for further analysis or testing. The
    strengths and limitations of this technique are discussed. Sample results

computed using a linear regression analysis to determine the fractional
contribution of each input parameter to the overall uncertainty. The 2-Ï

analysis, the primary contributors to the convective heating rate uncertainty
were the collision integrals for the N2 - N and {N2-O} species pairs. The
2-Ï values at the stagnation point were within 5.8\% of the mean convective
heating rate value. For the {FIRE} {II} analysis, the uncertainty of the
convective, radiative, and total heating were determined. The range of
variability for the radiative heating was less than that seen with the

of the total shear stress for the two types of flows suggests that the Couette

corresponding Couette flow values. The direction of rotation is chosen so that
it has a stabilizing effect, whereas the adverse pressure gradient is
destabilizing. The pressure-strain rate tensor in the Couette flow case is
presented for a split into slow, rapid and Stokes terms. Most of the influence
from rotation is located to the region close to the wall, and both the slow and
rapid parts are affected. The anisotropy for the boundary layer decreases for
higher Reynolds number, reflecting the larger separation of scales, and becomes
close to that for Couette flow. The adverse pressure gradient has a strong
weakening effect on the anisotropy. All of the data presented here are

exponential law in the outer region of turbulent boundary layer corresponding
new scaling laws for one- and two-point correlation functions. A direct

    abstract = {Turbulent mixing layers exhibit striking compressibility
effects. In particular, at modest Mach numbers, the growth rate of compressible
mixing layers is significantly reduced from that of incompressible mixing
layers. In this research, the relationship of this growth rate reduction to the
commonly observed large-scale structures in the mixing layer is investigated.
This goal is accomplished by performing direct numerical simulations of
compressible time-developing mixing layers. Two fields from the fully developed
incompressible mixing-layer simulations of Rogers and Moser are used to
construct initial conditions, one from the natural (unforced) simulation and
one from the 'strongly forced' simulation, which has much more prominent
two-dimensional mixing-layer structures. Cases were run at convective Mach
numbers of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2. It is found that significant compressible growth
rate reductions occur only in the cases in which two-dimensional flow
structures are prevalent. Flow visualization reveals that large spanwise
vortices are stretched and pairing is suppressed, leading to a reduction in
mixing layer growth. Structural change of large-scale structures induces a
decrease in cross-stream velocity fluctuations, Reynolds shear stress, and
magnitude of pressure fluctuations, consistent with the growth suppression
mechanism proposed by Vreman et al. and Freund et al. Direct numerical
simulations of turbulent flows require numerical schemes with high resolution
and grid flexibility. Resolution properties of {B}-spline and compact
finite-difference schemes are evaluated using Fourier analysis in periodic
domains, and tests based on solution of the wave and heat equations in finite
domains, with uniform and non-uniform grids. Results show that compact
finite-difference schemes have a higher convergence rate and in some cases
better resolution on uniform grids. However, {B}-spline schemes have more
consistent behavior on non-uniform grids, and a more straightforward and robust
formulation.},

    abstract = {A direct numerical simulation of a supersonic turbulent
boundary layer has been performed. We take advantage of a technique developed
by Spalart for incompressible flow. In this technique, it is assumed that the
boundary layer grows so slowly in the streamwise direction that the turbulence
can be treated as approximately homogeneous in this direction. The slow growth
is accounted for by a coordinate transformation and a multiple-scale analysis.
The result is a modified system of equations, in which the flow is homogeneous
in both the streamwise and spanwise directions, and which represents the state
of the boundary layer at a given streamwise location. The equations are solved
using a mixed Fourier and B-spline Galerkin {method.Results} are presented for
a case having an adiabatic wall, a Mach number of M = 2.5, and a Reynolds
number, based on momentum integral thickness and wall viscosity, of Reθ′ = 849.
The Reynolds number based on momentum integral thickness and free-stream
viscosity is Reθ = 1577. The results indicate that the Van Driest transformed
velocity satisfies the incompressible scalings and a small logarithmic region
is obtained. Both turbulence intensities and the Reynolds shear stress compare
well with the incompressible simulations of Spalart when scaled by mean
density. Pressure fluctuations are higher than in incompressible flow.
Morkovin's prediction that streamwise velocity and temperature fluctuations
should be anti-correlated, which happens to be supported by compressible
experiments, does not hold in the simulation. Instead, a relationship is found
between the rates of turbulent heat and momentum transfer. The turbulent
kinetic energy budget is computed and compared with the budgets from Spalart's

    abstract = {Core flow in a solid propellant rocket motor is often modeled
as the injection driven flow in a chamber closed at the head end. However, it
becomes expensive to conduct direct numerical simulations in this configuration
at moderately high Reynolds numbers. In the current study, a simplified model
for the core flow in a solid rocket motor has been devised that allows direct
numerical simulations to be conducted at a reasonable cost. In the simplified
model problem, the streamwise direction has been asymptotically homogenized by
assuming that at large distances from the head end of the rocket motor, both
the mean and {RMS} of turbulent fluctuations evolve slowly in the streamwise
direction. The {Navier-Stokes} equations are then modified to account for this
slow growth. Using the simplified model, a separate direct numerical simulation
can now be conducted at each streamwise location in the rocket motor. A direct
numerical simulation of compressible turbulent flow in the model rocket has
been conducted at a streamwise location situated 40 channel half-widths from
the head end of the rocket motor and at an injection Reynolds number of
approximately 190. The simulation reveals that turbulence results in increased
near wall gradients for streamwise velocity, density and temperature due to the
presence of the Reynolds stress term. The turbulence in the model rocket is
found to be only weakly compressible, although significant compressibility
existed in the mean flow. Streaks, streamwise vortices and inclined shear
layers are observed in the near wall region. The vorticity vector shows a
preference to be inclined at (39°-49°) to the wall, similar to observations
made in non-transpired channel flows. The direct numerical simulation database
is also used to make a priori estimates of the relative magnitudes of subgrid
terms in the filtered evolution equations. It is found that in the equations
for mean momentum and resolved scale Reynolds stress, the dominant subgrid
terms are the subgrid stress terms. The contribution of subgrid stress to wall
normal transport and dissipation in the resolved scale turbulent kinetic energy
equation are similar to those observed in turbulent channel flows.},

Vehicle was performed in the Arnold Engineering Development Center Hypervelocity Wind
Tunnel No. 9 Mach 8 and Mach 10 nozzles and in the {NASA} Langley Research Center 20-
Inch Mach 6 Air Tunnel. Heating data were obtained using a thermocouple-instrumented
\~{}0.035-scale model (0.1778-m / 7-inch diameter) of the flight vehicle. Runs were performed
in the Tunnel 9 Mach 10 nozzle at free stream unit Reynolds numbers of 1×106/ft to
20×106/ft, in the Tunnel 9 Mach 8 nozzle at free stream unit Reynolds numbers of 8×106/ft to
48×106/ft, and in the {20-Inch} Mach 6 Air Tunnel at free stream unit Reynolds numbers of
1×106/ft to 7×106/ft. In both facilities, enthalpy levels were low and the test gas (N2 in Tunnel
9 and air in the {20-Inch} Mach 6) behaved as a perfect-gas. These test conditions produced
laminar, transitional and turbulent data in the Tunnel 9 Mach 10 nozzle, transitional and
turbulent data in the Tunnel 9 Mach 8 nozzle, and laminar and transitional data in the 20-
Inch Mach 6 Air Tunnel. Laminar and turbulent predictions were generated for all wind
tunnel test conditions and comparisons were performed with the experimental data to help
define the accuracy of the computational method. In general, it was found that both laminar
data and predictions, and turbulent data and predictions, agreed to within less than the
estimated ±12\% experimental uncertainty estimate. Laminar heating distributions from all
three data sets were shown to correlate well and demonstrated Reynolds numbers
independence when expressed in terms of the Stanton number based on adiabatic wall-
recovery enthalpy. Transition onset locations on the leeside centerline were determined
from the data and correlated in terms of boundary-layer parameters. Finally turbulent
heating augmentation ratios were determined for several body-point locations and
correlated in terms of the boundary-layer momentum Reynolds number.},

conditions have been extended to Curvilinear co-ordinates for wall-bounded
flows. In addition to the non-reflecting boundary conditions, wall boundary
conditions have been derived and implemented for inflow/outflow-wall corners
(grid points common to the inflow/outflow and wall boundaries) so that the flow
solution at the corner points satisfies both the inflow/outflow boundary
conditions and the wall boundary conditions. Two-dimensional, wall-bounded,
Ringleb flow configurations (with non-orthogonal grids and curved boundary
geometries) were used as test cases to validate the non-reflecting boundary
conditions and the wall corner conditions. The wall corner conditions for the
Cartesian Giles boundary conditions were sufficient to eliminate the flow
through wall at inflow and outflow corners. However, the Cartesian Giles
boundary conditions along with the wall corner conditions could not solve the
corner problem in the Ringleb flow test cases and eventually caused the flow
solution to diverge. Two-dimensional Curvilinear Giles boundary conditions
derived from the Curvilinear form of the linearized Euler equations resulted in
additional terms that were not present in the chain rule form of Cartesian
Giles boundary conditions. These additional terms contained the factor (xx +
yy) which becomes zero for an orthogonal grid. The Curvilinear Giles boundary
conditions, when implemented without the additional terms, displayed the same
corner problem that was encountered with the chain rule form of Cartesian Giles
boundary conditions, proving the significance of the additional orthogonal
terms. In order to completely eliminate flow through the wall and obtain the
correct solution at the corners, the Curvilinear boundary conditions with the
additional terms and the wall corner conditions were required. The Curvilinear
Giles boundary conditions along with the wall corner conditions were
successfully tested on various Ringleb flow geometries and grid densities.
However, a long-term instability was noticed for all the Ringleb flow
configurations beyond a certain number of grid points. This was eliminated by
stretching the grid towards the inflow and outflow boundaries. Converged
solutions were obtained for all the test cases with acceptable L2 errors.}},

    abstract = {The compressible motion of gases has long been connected with high energy yield devices such as
combustors, jet engines, turbines, and rocket motors. Most available formulations for this high speed gaseous
environment lead to coupled nonlinear {PDEs}. While their integration requires the use of numerical methods,
their stability and convergence remain conditional on the stiffness of the system. In seeking reduced-order
models, it has become customary to introduce specific assumptions that simplify the problem's complexity
without sacrificing its fundamental physical attributes. Examples include the variety of {low-Mach} number
models for subsonic combustion and atmospheric flows, or the {high-Mach} number schemes used in the
treatment of hypersonic motions. The ensuing approximations constitute limiting process expressions of
the original equations and are often accompanied by their own stability and convergence criteria. Another
reduction in complexity may be accomplished by relaxing certain physical constraints or implementing
simplifying assumptions that correspond, if the situation permits, to inviscid, adiabatic, and non-reactive
models. A classic example is the study of acoustic instability in solid rocket motors where some analyses
consider the flow to be irrotational. For the variety of reasons mentioned, we consider in this work the
limiting potential case of the compressible gaseous motion not only in propulsion devices, such as rockets
and other confined thrust chambers, but also in external aerodynamic flows as well. In this spirit, we
derive the equations of motion for a steady, irrotational, compressible fluid in coordinate-independent vector
form. We accomplish this using two approaches, one based on the velocity potential, and the other using the
streamfunction formulation. In both instances, the spatial dependence of the speed of sound is eliminated in
favor of its stagnation value. This key aspect of the present framework enables us to systematically apply the
{Rayleigh-Janzen} asymptotic technique to explicitly solve the compressible potential equations in the {low-Mach}
number limit. While the procedure is rather straightforward with the velocity potential, auxiliary relations are
required when using the streamfunction approach. By way of example, the two formulations developed here
are implemented to the extent of producing analytical approximations for two geometric settings associated
with the irrotational compressible flowfields in planar and cylindrical rocket motors.},

@article{Cal2008Similarity,
    abstract = {Using similarity analysis, the scales and similarity
constraints for a favorable pressure gradient ({FPG}) turbulent boundary layer
with eventual quasilaminarization are obtained. In order to achieve equilibrium
in the boundary layer, the pressure parameter Λ must be a constant; thus, a
power relation between the boundary layer thickness δ and the free-stream
velocity U∞ exists. Consequently, the power is given by the pressure parameter
Λ as δ ∼ U∞−1/Λ. Through an analysis using the pressure parameter, two
quadrants are found: quadrant I describes {FPG} turbulent flows and quadrant
{II} corresponds to quasilaminar flows. Moreover, a horizontal line exists for
zero pressure gradient flows. Different values of the pressure parameter are
found for equilibrium {FPG} flows, contrary to the findings of Castillo and
George [ ” Similarity analysis for turbulent boundary layer with pressure
gradient: Outer flow,” {AIAA} J. 39, 41 (2001) ]. In the case of strong {FPG}
flows with quasilaminarization, the pressure parameter reaches a maximum value
of 0.47. At this point, a sudden reduction in the skin friction of about 57\%
is observed and a redistribution of the Reynolds stresses throughout the
boundary layer is achieved. The mean velocity deficit profiles are also found
to be attenuated when scaled using the free-stream velocity U∞ or U∞δ∗/δ. For
flows in quadrant {II}, a reduction in the outer flow of the 〈u2〉 component
of the Reynolds stress is observed, whereas the 〈v2〉 and −〈uv〉 components
nearly vanish impending quasilaminarization. Due to the presence of the 〈u2〉
component in the boundary layer, the flow never reaches a full laminar state
and a more uniform redistribution of the component is observed as the skin
friction decreases due to the imposed {FPG}. Furthermore, the shape of the
profile remains the same until a quasilaminar state is reached, where the
profile no longer shows high values of the stress on the proximity to the wall.
In addition, the production term −〈{uv〉dU}/dy is nearly zero for flows in
quadrant {II}. Also, the boundary layer parameters such as the shape factor H
and the ratio of the displacement thickness to the boundary layer thickness,
δ∗/δ, increase as the flow achieves a quasilaminar state.},

numerical simulation ({DNS}) of wall bounded turbulent flow (channel flow).
{DNS} is a technique in which the fluid flow equations are solved without
subgrid modeling. Of particular interest are high Reynolds number (Re)
turbulent flows over walls, because of their importance in technological
applications. Simulating high Re turbulence is a challenging computational
problem, due to the high spatial and temporal resolution requirements. An
optimized code was developed using spectral methods, the method of choice for
turbulent flows. Optimization was performed to address three major issues:
efficiency of banded matrix linear algebra, cache reuse and memory access, and
communication for the global data transposes. Results show that performance is
highly dependent on characteristics of the communication network, rather than
single core performance. In our tests, it exhibits approximately 80\% strong
scaling parallel efficiency at {786K} cores relative to performance on {65K}
cores.},

@inproceedings{Langou2006Exploiting,
    abstract = {Recent versions of microprocessors exhibit performance
characteristics for 32 bit floating point arithmetic (single precision) that is
substantially higher than 64 bit floating point arithmetic (double precision).
Examples include the Intel's Pentium {IV} and M processors, {AMD}'s Opteron
architectures and the {IBM}'s Cell Broad Engine processor. When working in
single precision, floating point operations can be performed up to two times
faster on the Pentium and up to ten times faster on the Cell over double
precision. The performance enhancements in these architectures are derived by
accessing extensions to the basic architecture, such as {SSE2} in the case of
the Pentium and the vector functions on the {IBM} Cell. The motivation for this
paper is to exploit single precision operations whenever possible and resort to
double precision at critical stages while attempting to provide the full double
precision results. The results described here are fairly general and can be
applied to various problems in linear algebra such as solving large sparse
systems, using direct or iterative methods and some eigenvalue problems. There
are limitations to the success of this process, such as when the conditioning
of the problem exceeds the reciprocal of the accuracy of the single precision
computations. In that case the double precision algorithm should be used.},

collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually
developed by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as
algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist underneath
the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel, including
configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking.  \par Here we
present the overall Trilinos design, describing our use of abstract interfaces
and default concrete implementations. We discuss the services that Trilinos
provides to a prospective package and how these services are used by various
packages. We also illustrate how packages can be combined to rapidly develop
new algorithms. Finally, we discuss how Trilinos facilitates highquality

@Article{Steinberg1985Symbolic,
  abstract  = { the problem of numerically integrating general elliptic
          differential equations in irregular two and three
          dimensional regions is discussed. the method used
          numerically computes a transformation of the given region
          into a rectangular region. the numerical coordinate
          transformation is determined by requiring that the
          components of the transformation satisfy inhomogeneous
          Laplace or more general equations. the transformation is
          then used to transform the differential equation and the
          boundary conditions to the rectangular region. the boundary
          value problem in the rectangular region is integrated using
          one of the standard methods for general elliptic equations.
          the use of the existing software reduces the problem to
          analytically transforming the given differential equation
          and the Laplacian to general coordinate frame and then
          writing subroutines that will tabulate the coefficients of
          these differential equations using the tabulated coordinate
          transformation. This method has been successfully used in
          two dimensions so we are concerned with the three
          dimensional extension of the existing codes where the major
          problem encountered is the volume of algebra and coding
          required to complete the method. To overcome these
          difficulties, a symbol manipulation program in VAXIMA is
          written that has as input the formula for the given
          differential equation in some natural coordinates and has
          as output the required FORTRAN subroutines. Because of the
          complexity of the resulting code, code validation was
          performed by systematic truncation error testing. the paper
          concludes with a discussion of the problems encountered in
          using a symbol manipulator to write large FORTRAN codes.},

half-width and the friction velocity averaged on the two walls, was set to be
150, whereas the Prandtl number was 0.71. The walls were assumed to be kept at
isothermal but different temperatures. With any buoyancy effect neglected,
temperature was considered as a passive scalar. The computation was executed on
sufficiently dense grid points by using a spectral method. The statistics
obtained include the mean velocity and temperature, Reynolds stresses, and
turbulent heat fluxes. Each term in the budget equations of the second-order
velocity and temperature correlations and of their destruction rates was also
calculated. It is found that the injection decreases the friction coefficient,
but tends to stimulate the near-wall turbulence activity so that the Reynolds
stresses and turbulent heat fluxes are increased, whereas the suction has an
inverse influence.},
