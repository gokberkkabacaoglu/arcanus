% Including external files for each chapter makes this document simpler,
% makes each chapter simpler, and allows for generating test documents
% with as few as zero chapters (by commenting out the include statements).
% This allows quicker processing by the Makediss command file in case you
% are not working on a specific, long and slow to compile chapter. You
% can even change the chapter order by merely interchanging the order
% of the include statements (something I found helpful in my own
% dissertation).
