This chapter details some of the early simulations and investigations
of the SoV. The chapter begins with a study of the thermal-only
conditions. Comparisons between the synthetic dust-devils of the SoV and
available data from the natural variety are performed. The chapter then
proceeds to a simple wind case. Next, a discussion of the optimization
procedure is detailed. Finally, the chapter concludes with an
investigation into the effect of the wind versus the thermally-driven buoyancy. 

% Finally, the chapter attempts to discern some of
% the physical processes driving the SoV. 

\section{Thermal Only Simulations}
\label{sec:thermal_only}

%While ambient winds in the field impact system performance, it is
%also illuminating to consider an idealized scenario with natural
%convection driven only by thermal instabilities. 

First, we consider the ``thermal-only'' case, which is 
where the natural convection is driven only by thermal instabilities. 
Simulations of this
baseline, thermal-only flow are intended to ensure the SoV apparatus to
form a strong thermal plume even in the absence of
wind. Programmatically, these simulations were conducted before the
introduction of the wind, as the fully extent of the wind's impact was
not yet realized. 

In this section a representative case of an optimized thermal-only SoV
configuration is presented. This is a simple curved vane configuration with
two-tiers with ground temperature of 335 Kelvin and a freestream
temperature of 313 Kelvin. There is no ambient velocity and the boundary
conditions are as described in Chapter~\ref{sec:bc}.  

The two tiers of vanes used for these cases are drawn in
Figures~\ref{fig:thermal_vane_bottom} and \ref{fig:thermal_vane_top}.  
Note that in this configuration, the vanes are aligned radially at the
largest radius, and then increasingly curve towards azimuthal at smaller
radius. Note also that these images are representative curves of the
body forcing field, and do not actually represent vane surfaces. The
vanes are represented as a body force as detailed in
Chapter~\ref{subsec:vane}. These images are created by tracing the path
a particle follows through the forcing field. The 
region of forcing is between $\{0.3-0.9\}$ meters for the bottom tier,
and $\{0.6-0.9\}$ meters for the top tier. Overall, the system is 1.1
meters tall, with the short first tier only standing 0.132 meters
high. The top and bottom tiers have final angles of $70^{\circ}$ and
$85^{\circ}$, respectively. No cone is used in this case.

The results shown were from transient solutions (the unsteady virtual
vanes) and so the images of the fields are averages of fifty snapshots
of the solution taken over the course of ten minutes. In general, the
averaging times are selected to be approximately 20 to 30 wash-out
times, where a wash-out is defined as the time required for a particle
at the base of the apparatus to flow out through the top boundary. The
kinetic energy flux through the top of the vanes for this case is about
53 Watts. The solution demonstrates several features characteristic of
naturally occurring dust devils. Figure~\ref{fig:thermal} shows a
temperature isocontour set at threshold of 3 Kelvin higher than the
ambient fluid temperature. This value was selected because it was noted
by Sinclair~\cite{Sinclair1969} as characteristic of the thermal core 
temperature above the ambient temperature observed in dust devils. The
image depicts a tight, coherent thermal plume roughly the same size as
the inner diameter of the lower vanes. As anticipated, this hot flow is
acting like a chimney, generating a large vertical velocity which in
turn entrains air from the outside.  

An image of the entrainment is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:entrain}. The
image was created by tracking particles as they convect through the
device. Tracer particles were seeded into the averaged flowfield and
then advancing through the field using a fourth order Runge-Kutta integrator.  
There is clearly a tight inner vortex with significant azimuthal
velocity and a broader region of entraining fluid through the upper tier
of vanes. This is consistent with the imagined structure of a dust devil
presented in Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon}.

Figure~\ref{fig:to-vert} depicts several vertical slices through the SoV
for various state variables. A strong thermal plume is visible at the
center of the device, which drives a vertical velocity. The fluid flow
is entrained by this vertical movement and pulled radially into the
center while being turned by the turning vanes. Notice also the low
pressure ``eye'' at the center of the flow, and the modest downward flow
in the center of the vertical velocity, consistent with
Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon}.

 \label{fig:to-hor}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:to-hor}, depicts several horizontal slices
through the SoV for the same state variables. It can be seen that the
large velocities are highly localized to a region just inside the
vanes. Likewise, the entrainment of fluid is limited to a region
immediately surrounding the vanes.
%
% conclusion of thermal only
%
Finally, the thermal plume is relatively narrow compared to the diameter
of the device. It is desirable to broaden the thermal plume, as this
would create a larger vertical momentum flux and consequentally a larger
kinetic energy flux.  
The diameter of the thermal core is therefore a critical flow
characteristic in the thermal-only conditions. However, a means of
setting the thermal plume's thickness is not presently 
known. Regardless, these slices lend credibilty to the 
notion that our turning vane configuration is generating something with 
visible parallels to a naturally occurring dust devil.   

These parallels are more precisely shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:rankene}. Here, the azimuthal velocity in the vortex
core and slightly outside of this region is compared to the Rankene
vortex model. The profile is generally consistent with the Rankene
vortex model. The velocity in the inner core region roughly obeys a
solid body rotation, with a linear velocity profile before the region
adjacent to the peak. Around the peak, the profile does not form a sharp
interface between the inner and outer regions. This is almost certainly
on account of the interface being smoothed out through the diffusivity
model. In the outer region, the velocity decays at a rate broadly
consistent with the anticipated $1/r$ predicted in a Rankene vortex. 
The outer region simulation has small fluctuations which are expected to
be on account of the finite temporal averaging, and are not meaningful. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=.85\linewidth]{figs/rankene}
 \caption{The thermal-only temporally averaged azimuthal velocity (blue
 line) compared to the predicted 
 velocity in the Rankene vortex model (black line). The velocity in the
 inner core region is approximately consistent with a rigid body
 rotation, with the peak and surrounding region more diffusive. The
 wiggles in the region outside of the core (and outside of the turning
 vanes) is nearly zero, and the wiggles in the profile are expected to
 be averaging artifacts.} 
 \label{fig:rankene}  
\end{figure}

These results are consistent with the measured profiles of Sinclair,
who's data indicated that naturally occurring dust devil's velocity
profiles did not substantially deviate from the Rankene model. 
This provides a degree of belief that the SoV is generating a
thermal vortex that shares physical similarities with naturally
occurring dust devils. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that this
is qualitatively similar to simulated tornado velocity
profiles~\cite{nolan1999structure}, which also have a Rankene-like
character. In the abstract, these results indicate 
the SoV structure occupies a place in a broader space of fundamental 
fluid structures of columnar vortices. While not further investigated
here, this does indicate that these simulations might be a useful tool
for further investigations of the physics of dust devils and vortex
structures.

\section{Wind Simulations}

On account of the extremely modest kinetic energy fluxes measured in the
thermal-only conditions, simulations were performed to explore the
available energy flux and solution character in the presence of ambient
winds. 
The representative wind case show here is for a 3 m/s ambient wind with
a ground temperature of 335 Kelvin and freestream temperature of 313
Kelvin. There is no ambient velocity and the boundary conditions are as
described in Chapter~\ref{sec:bc}. The vanes are drawn in
Figures~\ref{fig:wind_bottom} and \ref{fig:wind_top}. These images show
the straight vane case, and a cone that sits on top of the second tier of vanes. 
As in the previous section, these images are representative
curves of the body forcing field, and do not actually represent vane
surfaces. The vanes are represented as in Chapter~\ref{subsec:vane}. 
These images are created by tracing the path a particle follows through
the forcing field (see Section~\ref{subsec:scenario_param}). The region
of forcing is between $\{0.96-3.4\}$ meters 
for the bottom tier, and $\{1.5-3.4\}$ meters for the top tier. Overall,
the system is three meters tall, with the short first tier only standing
0.3 meters high. The top and bottom tiers have final angles of
$70^{\circ}$ and $80^{\circ}$, respectively.

 as in the thermal-only cases.  Note that an off-center thermal plume is
 visible, as well. An outline of the virtual vanes are drawn in black to
 show the region of forcing.}  
 \label{fig:wind-hor}
\end{figure}


Horizontal slices of the azimuthal and vertical velocities, and the 
temperature and in-plane velocity (e.g. $\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}$) are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:wind-hor}. The freestream velocity is traveling from
left to right at 3 m/s, which was set based on ambient velocity
measurements made by the experimental team from the field. While the
structure is undoubtedly different than the thermal-only cases shown
previously, we can nevertheless see that a thermal plume is forming
along with a rotating velocity structure. In general the wind cases are
more disorganized, with less obviously visible coherent
structure. The velocity profile no longer adheres to the Rankene model,
in part because of the significant azimuthal asymmetry in the resulting
velocity fields. 
Notice however that the magnitude of velocities are several
times larger than in the thermal-only cases, and the kinetic energy flux
through the vanes is also significantly higher.

  appears to dissipate near the top of the vanes, this is due to the
 fact that the thermal column is not well centered. The full column is
 visible in Figure~\ref{fig:field_real}. The vane and cone forcing region is
 outlined in black.}
 \label{fig:wind-ver}
\end{figure}

The vertical slices are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:wind-ver}.In this 
case, the lower tier of vanes are where the majority of flow is 
entering the center of the apparatus, while the second tier of vanes are
blocking the ambient wind and providing protection for the vortex column. 

The thermal plume is much more complicated than in the thermal-only
cases. While the thermal-plume is necessarily weaker relative to the
wind, some of this is also due to the plume no longer being directly
centered in the flow. The plume is more visible using isocountors to
render a three-dimensional surface. 
To visualize the difference between the vertically varying ambient
temperature and the warmer thermal plume, we use the potential
temperature, defined as, 
\begin{equation}
  \tau(x,y,z) = T(x,y,z) -T_{\text{in}}(z) 
   \label{eqn:tau}
\end{equation}
where $T_{\text{in}}$ is the inflow temperature, described
in Chapter \ref{sec:bc}. In this way the background potential
temperature is nearly zero, and larger values represent deviations from
the base flow temperature. The isocountour of a three Kelvin threshold
is  shown in Figure~\ref{fig:field_real}. This value was selected as
it was noted as characteristic for the formation of a dust devil by
Sinclair~\cite{Sinclair1969}. It is clear from the image that a 
strong thermal column exists even in the 3 m/s wind cases.

\section{Optimization}
\label{sec:opt}

In this section results from a representative optimization
in a thermal-only case are discussed, to demonstrate the optimization  
process employed. Broadly speaking, the heuristic is a typical mode of
scientific and engineering inquiry, where a hypothesis regarding system
operation is developed, followed by testing of the hypothesis, and further
iterations.  

This series of simulations are all runs with different system
configurations conducted in a common ambient scenario, that of the
unsteady thermal-only simulations described in Chapter~\ref{sec:bc}. 

Our objective is to maximize the energy that can be 
extracted from the synthetic dust devil. As a surrogate to this
quantity, consider the kinetic energy flux through a horizontal plane
near the top of the vanes, where a turbine will ultimately be
placed. This is a surface integral~\cite{landau1959fm},

 larger and more organized vortex. The flow has also transitioned into a
 ``two-cell'' structure akin to that observed in the naturally occuring
 phenomena as discussed in Chapter \ref{subsec:phenomena}. An outline of
 the virtual vanes are drawn in black to show the region of forcing.}
  \label{fig:opt_flow}
\end{figure}

Using the kinetic energy flux as an objective, the vane geometry has
been optimized. Over approximately tens of iterations, the increased the
kinetic energy flux was increased by a factor of 88 relative to the 
baseline.

 \label{fig:opt_image}
\end{figure}


%Results of several of these iterations are documented in
%Figure \ref{fig:opt_plot}. 
Major adjustments to design in the the vane shape and angles were made
to obtain this improvement. The general iteration procedure is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:opt_image}. This iteration procedure was never
automated, and every iteration required human intervention. A system 
parameter such as vane angle was adjusted by providing a modest change
(typically a few percent) around the initial state. A simulation was
then performed, after which the kinetic energy flux at the height of the
vanes was compared to the previous iteration. If the flux increased,
the new parameter value was accepted and was used in subsequent runs. In
general, all system parameters were varied, aside from the overall
system diameter, which was fixed. 

%discuss why no numerical optimization

%this is a risk that would exist even with numerical optimization
%Local minimums. 

Before and after images are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:opt_flow}. During this optimization 
the qualitative character of the solution changed substantially,
changing from a mild upward flow with little rotation to a strongly
organized vortex with a downward central flow and strong azimuthal 
velocities. Before and after vertical slices are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:opt_flow}. Nevertheless, with a peak energy flux for the
final iteration of less than one hundred Watts, significant further 
optimization is necessary for this system to be viable for use as an 
energy production system. Due to the very mild kinetic energy fluxes in
this device, it became apparent that the wind was a more substantial
driver of the vortex energy budget than had previously been understood. 
This naturally leads to the next section, which details some of the
investigations into the impact of the wind on the SoV performance. 
%which is a discussion of the optimized configuration results. 

It should be noted that this heuristic is by no means exhaustive, and it
is not expected that the final configurations are indeed located at the
fixed point of optimal design, but that they are adjacent to a local
optimum with some modest error. As this project is designed to broadly
explore the feasibility of the concept, a small percentage increase of
energy flux is not expected to change the conclusions. 

A more significant concern is that this heuristic will only discover a
local optimum, and so will miss the global optimum which could yield a
significantly larger energy flux. This risk exists even if
numerical optimization algorithms were used. Unfortunately, the kinetic
energy surface for these systems do appear to posses multiple local
optimums, and different designs were on several occasions found to possess
similar kinetic energy fluxes. The risk of discovering a local 
and not the global optimum was attempted to be mitigated by starting
with multiple initial configurations with different initial
parameters. However, typically this was performed only a handful of
times for each configuration, and the variation in the initial state of
the parameters was arbitrary. 

\section{The Effect of the Wind}
\label{sec:wind_impact}

% Regarding question number 2, you want to optimize the lift vector (see
% the figure below).  For the figure, pretend you are sitting to the side
% of the turbine as the blade is moving up.  We want the L vector to be as
% close to vertical as possible (in the useful torque direction that will
% pull the blade up).  In order to do that you need to optimize the
% Lift/Drag, but you also need to minimize the downwash (Utheta0 and Uz0
% vectors) as the downwash will turn the lift vector away from the useful
% torque direction.   Atkins and Liebeck show how to minimize the downwash
% at a given design condition for a given a set of optimum airfoils.  You
% can directly solve for blade twist and planform to make sure downwash is
% minimized and each airfoil is at its Max L/D, but this often gives rotor
% designs that are not robust and structurally infeasible.
% However, it will give you an idea of what the ideal blade looks like at
% different conditions and then you can work to find a more robust
% solution and add structural constraints as well.   

An important question throughout this work is: to what extend does the wind
drive the kinetic energy flux through the SoV device? At the same time, 
it is not intended for the SoV to be a direct competitor to convention wind turbines,
where the device is entirely driven by kinetic energy from ambients winds which drive 
a vertical axes (instead of the horizontal axis turbines more typically 
used in conventional wind turbines). It is expected that the buoyancy contributed
by the heated ground also plays a critical role in the formation and sustainment of 
the synthetic dust devils, just as it is necessary in the natural phenomenon. 
At the same time, as was discussed in Section~\ref{sec:opt}, 
the kinetic energy flux through an optimized device in the thermal-only conditions
never attains a magnitude that would make the device competitive. 
Furthermore, the kinetic energy flux in the thermal-only conditions 
is substantially lower than estimated in the naturally occurring objects, 
perhaps indicating that these natural entities are driven by additional sources, 
namely, ambient winds.
This section represents a more systematic investigation into the role of the wind 
in the present SoV device. 

Figure~\ref{fig:wind_impact} shows two simulated wind cases. The first, 
where the wind is also accompanied by a heated surface (solid blue line, labelled ``hot wind''), 
and the other where the flow has no temperature variations (dashed green line, the ``cold wind''). 
As expected, the measured kinetic energy flux in these cases increases with higher wind velocity. 
It is clear from these curves that the kinetic energy flux has a non-linear scaling with
wind velocity, as anticipated in Section~\ref{sec:estimate_power}. 

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{figs/wind_impact}
 \caption{wind} 
 \label{fig:wind_impact}  
\end{figure}

It can be seen that the energy output doubles when a temperature
variation is introduced. And yet, the 

mass flux increases, in particular thorugh the back! so its more than
just wind.
