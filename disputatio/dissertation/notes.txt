Proposal notes:

prof bogard:
  how to discover impact of buoyancy vs. wind
  use aerofoil cd/cl

todd:
  richer validation
  (model form uncertainty due to atmo model)

  Under what conditions are we able to characterize 
  the uncertainty?

  Can gridded perhaps provide a clue?


dk: 
  wind turbine vs. buoyancy 
  def of flux

charles jackson:
  interested in genesis 
  interested in hurricane tornado
