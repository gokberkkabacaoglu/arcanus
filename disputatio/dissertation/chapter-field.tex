\label{sec:field}

The steady virtual vane model was used to explore a broad set of
system configurations and to optimize the system turning vane
configuration to optimize for the kinetic energy flux flowing through
the SoV. Based on the lessons learned in Chapter~\ref{sec:results}, as
well a dedicated optimization effort, a new configuration was created
and explored computationally. The resulting configuration represents a
significant change from that used in the August 2015 Field test. This
chapter begins by describing the geometry of the device and the design
optimization that lead to this configuration. Next is a detailed look
at the turbine design incorporated into the SoV to extract energy from
the flow. A field prediction based entirely on the computational effort is
then provided. Some of the model shortcomings of this design are
considered, with corrections to the model inadequacy proposed and the
results of these corrections to the baseline models explored. Finally,
the chapter concludes with an estimate of the maximal energy that could
be extracted from an idealized turbine placed within this device.   

\section{System Geometry}

The new field geometry represents a significant departure from
the August 2015 system, which was designed largely by the experimental
team at Georgia Tech. Computer Aided Design (CAD) images of the 2015
system from the top and side are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cad_aug_2015},
albeit without the cone. An actual image of the 2015 field configuration
is in Figure~\ref{fig:aug_2015_field}. The inner diameter of the second
tier vanes for this apparatus was six meters, and the overall vane
height was nearly three meters. The second tier vanes were straight and
constructed out of fiberglass. The sixty minute time averaged integral
of the kinetic energy flux was measured at 107 Watts, but demonstrated
large variations, with an RMS of 79.4 Watts and a peak power of 784
Watts. The peak power corresponds to periods with the largest ambient
wind velocities, and this is considered a guideline for the 
importance of the wind in the newly proposed asymmetric design.

   author using FreeCAD\cite{Falck}.}

Starting from this baseline, and armed with the steady virtual vane
model, a dedicated design effort was embarked upon explore a large space
of possible system configurations and geometries to discover the
structure of a new SoV apparatus. To arrive at the present design, the
workflow consisted of weekly calls with the experimental team to discuss
possible system designs, which typically consisted of vane sketches or
drawings.  

This conceptual phase generated a wide range of possible
configurations, few of which showed enough promise to warrant further
investigation. The designs that had initially promising results were
then optimized similar to the examples outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:results}, where new parameter values were introduced, a
run was performed, and then the output is postprocessed to evaluate the
Power output before the process begins again. In this way several
hundred optimization runs were performed over the course of several
months. While not provably exhaustive, this dedicated exploration of the 
SoV configuration space was an extensive effort and no major concepts
generated within the constraints of the principle SoV concept detailed
in Section~\ref{sec:dust_devil_concept} remain.

   \label{fig:aug_2015_field}
  \end{figure}

The new configuration is a highly asymmetric design, intended to capture
a much greater area of incoming wind and draw it into the center of the
device. Horizontal and vertical views of the new optimized configuration
are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:top_design},\ref{fig:bottom_design} and
\ref{fig:vertical_design}, below. The actual parametric values of these
vanes are detailed in Tables~\ref{tab:top},\ref{tab:bottom} and
\ref{tab:side}. This design does have some notable 
similarities to the previous efforts. It still retains the two-tier
design outlined Section~\ref{sec:dust_devil_concept}. The inner diameter 
of the 2\textsuperscript{nd} tier vanes remains six meters, and the
bottom tier is much shorter than the second tier. A brief summary of the
differences are provided below:      

\begin{itemize}
\item The bottom tier vanes are taller than the previous field test
\item The bottom tier vanes downwind side is taller 
\item An impermeable cylinder was introduced along the arc $\{\pi < \theta
      < 0 \}$, e.g. the bottom two quadrants in the images below, replacing the
vanes in those quadrants. 
\item The upper tier vanes were configured to align with the freestream
velocity, to provide a larger wind-driven flux into the facility.
\item Horizontal partitions were added to the top of the upper vanes, to
prevent flow in the vanes from rising up and out of the vanes
\item The cone is taller providing a greater contraction
\end{itemize}

We now discuss each of these bullets in detail. Upon inspection, the
bottom tier vanes were found to be too short, and so were unnecessarily
constricting the flow through them. Originally, the height of the lower
tier vanes were set based on thermal boundary layer considerations, but
detailed computational inspection found that the boundary layer inside
the vanes was considerably thicker than a back-of-the-envelope
measurement would indicate. It is presumed that this is a result of the
convection of thermal resource into the device from ambient winds and
the strong radial entrainment from the vortex. If true, then a shorter
first tier is a substantial impediment to the intensification of the
vortex, as it limits the inflow of thermal resource which, as detailed
in Section\ref{sec:wind_impact}, notably plays a substantial role in the
measured vortex energy flux. 

The lower tier vanes are now asymmetric. The downwind side
is substantially taller (by a factor of two) than the upwind side. This
is due to the downwind boundary layer being thicker on account of it
possessing a lower Reynolds number. The Reynolds number is lower on the
downwind side because it does not possess the benefit of a strong wind
forcing the flow through the vanes. Due to this, the downwind lower tier
vanes also have a lower peak turning angle to reduce blockage.

Despite repeat efforts, the downwind side of the second tier vanes were
never found to entrain flow from the wake, even with the vane separation
model detailed in Section~\ref{sec:separation}. As ``leakage'' of the
vortex out the back of the SoV has been a noted issue in the past, it
was decided to introduce an impermeable cylindrical wall along the
regions where leakage was observed to occur in the simulations. 

The most visually striking change between the current configuration and
the previous field test is in the second tier vanes. As the wind was
believed to play a substantial role in providing energy flux to the
vortex, the upper tier vanes were redesigned to capture as much of this
energy as possible. To do this, the vanes were extended far out in the
streamwise direction and designed to align with the freestream velocity
in this location. This broken symmetry introduces a failure mode, as it
requires that the SoV be aligned with the streamwise velocity. This
design decision is discussed in more detail in
Section~\ref{subsec:scenario_param}. 

The upper tier vanes also now possess horizontal partitions. By placing
a flat horizontal ``top'' on the vanes, flow is constrained from
vertically leaving the SoV apparatus before it is forced into the
center. This horizontal partition is clearly visible in
Figure~\ref{fig:top_down_cad}.   

The cone plays at least two important roles. The first is acting as a
converging nozzle for the flow, increasing the vertical and azimuthal
velocity as it exits out the top of the device. Additionally, much akin
to a wind tunnel contraction, the cone was found to increase the
symmetry of the flow near the exit. This is appealing as the turbine is
more readily capable of extracting power from a symmetric velocity
field. The second important role for the cone was found to be that in
the wind, the cone also acts as a shield, preventing the high velocity
freestream flow from disrupting the vortex before it has run through the
turbine. Both of these effects were observed to increase with a taller
cone than had been previously used.

It is important to note that while increasing the height of the cone
(and along with it, the contraction ratio) was recommended, due to
time and fabrication constraints this particular cone design was not
implemented. The cone design quoted below was the cone used by
the field team, despite being found to be sub-optimal in
simulations. All the simulations shown in this chapter are consistent
with the design used in the 2016 field tests, and this unrealized cone
optimization is noted for completeness.

An optimal set of design parameters were determined and provided to the
experimental group, where they were instantiated as CAD designs by
Mr. John Culp at Georgia Tech. Images of the resulting model were generated
with FreeCAD~\cite{Falck} by the author and are
depicted in Figures~\ref{fig:top_down_cad} and \ref{fig:cad_skewed},
which show a top-down view of the configuration and a skewed
view of the incoming flow. In both cases the bottom, top and cone are
clearly visible. After final detailed checks of the resulting
configuration's angles, lengths, etc. the CAD design was used for
fabrication of the 2016 Field SoV Prototype.

\subsection{Turning Vane Interpolation Functions}
\label{sec:interpolate}

The top tier design is now highly asymmetric, with a
large opening facing the incoming wind to capture incoming free stream
kinetic energy over a large area. The incoming flow enters the central
cylindrical area, where it spins and is driven out the top through the
cone. To enable these more asymmetric vane geometries for the top tier,
it was necessary to formulate a more general parameterization of the
vanes.

Previously, the vanes had a linear curvature function and were
axisymmetric. The new concept required the vanes to hold an azimuthal
dependence so that they are aligned with the streamwise velocity upstream 
of the device, and then curve inward to spin the flow at the center of
the device. A linear vane curvature was first attempted, but this was
found to have too few degrees of freedom to provide adjustments to the
vane curvature. Next, vanes that had an elliptic curvature were decided
upon. The intent here is to have a quarter of an ellipse, where the arc
of the ellipse starts at the x-intercept (thus ensuring the vane is
aligned with the freestream velocity) and then curves in towards the
center of the device, terminating at a high angle nearly azimuthal. To
accomplish this, the normal vector of the ellipse must be known. 

This required use of implicit differentiation for the functional,

\begin{eqnarray}
 f(x,y)  =& \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1, \\
 \nabla f(x,y) =& \frac{2 (x-h)}{a^2} + \frac{2 (y-k)}{b^2}\frac{dy}{dx} = 0, \\
 \frac{dy}{dx} =& -\frac{(x-h)}{(y-k)}\frac{b^2}{a^2}. 
\end{eqnarray}
Where h and k are the elliptic intercepts and a and b are the
eccentricity of the ellipse along each axis. The tangent vector along
the ellipse is then,  
\begin{eqnarray}
 %{\bf \hat t} = {\bf e_x} + \frac{dy}{dx}{\bf e_y}, \\
 {\bf t} =& {\bf e_x} + \frac{dy}{dx}{\bf e_y}, \\
 {\bf t} =& \underbrace{\frac{(y-k)}{b^2}}_{a_y} {\bf e_x} -
  \underbrace{\frac{(x-h)}{a^2}}_{a_x}{\bf e_y} \\
 {\bf t} =& {a_y} {\bf e_x} - {a_x}{\bf e_y}. 
\end{eqnarray}

Noting that the normal vector has the form, 
\begin{eqnarray}
 {\bf n} =& {a_x} {\bf e_x} + {a_y}{\bf e_y}, \label{eqn:a_x}\\
 {\bf n} =& \frac{(x-h)}{a^2} {\bf e_x} + \frac{(y-k)}{b^2} {\bf e_y}.
\end{eqnarray}

This now defines the normal vector. However, we need to determine the 
constants (namely, $k,b$) that define ellipses that capture the shape we
desire. We want to determine an ellipse that has a certain
slope, m, at a specific point,  $(x_0,y_o)$, which lies on the inner
radius (R) of the SoV apparatus. This is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:elliptic_vane_concept}. We have a system of four
equations,
\begin{eqnarray}
 \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} =& 1, \label{eq:ell1}\\
 \frac{(x_0-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y_0-k)^2}{b^2} =& 1, \label{eq:ell2}  \\
 x_0^2 + y_0^2 =& R, \label{eq:ell3} \\
 -\frac{b^2}{a^2}\frac{(x_0-h)}{(y_0-k)} =& m. \label{eq:ell4} 
\end{eqnarray}
These equations express the fact that the ellipse intercepts both known
points, that the point $(x_0,y_o)$ lies on the inner radius of the
apparatus, and that the slope at this point is known. Assuming that
h, a, x, y, R and m are given, we have a system of four equations
(Equations \ref{eq:ell1}-\ref{eq:ell4}) with four unknowns,
$x_0,y_0,k,b$. This is, in principle, sufficient information to solve
this system. However, in practice, significant difficulties were
encountered. Inverting this system by hand is too complex and error
prone, and furthermore, Mathematica was unable to find a closed-form
solution. Numerous simplifications and additional constraints were added
to ensure that the system of equations were well-posed (a>b, for
instance), but the problem still resisted solution. 

 \begin{figure}[!htb]
  \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width =0.95\textwidth]{figs/elliptic_vane_concept}
   \caption{The geometric problem for the elliptic vanes.}
   \label{fig:elliptic_vane_concept}
  \end{center}
 \end{figure}

The problem then, is that for a given location $(x,y)$ in space we are
unable to invert to determine the character of the ellipse that
intersects that point. Instead, we can pose the problem as discretizing
the arc along the inner radius of the vanes, we can generate data from
several curves that can be used to calibrate a 2D polynomial that will
smoothly vary in space. To accomplish this, we choose a series of
$x_0,y_0$ curves. For each unique ellipse defined by ($x_0,y_0,b,a,k$),
discretize at a uniform interval between $\left[-h,x_0\right]$, and
solve for the accompanying y-value, 
\begin{equation}
 y = -b \sqrt{1-\frac{(x-h)}{a^2}} + k. 
\end{equation}
One now has sufficient information to solve for the normal coefficients
$a_x$ and $a_y$ as defined in Equation~\ref{eqn:a_x}. This array of
coefficients specified at (x,y) are now fit to a 2D N\textsuperscript{th}
order polynomial. This has the form, 

\begin{equation}
 P(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^N  \sum_{j=0}^N a_{i,j} x^i y^j
\end{equation}

where $a_{i,j}$ are coefficients of the polynomial which are selected by
minimizing the residual between the specified vane values and the
polynomial evaluated at that point. In other words, we find the
least-squares solution to a linear matrix equation, which is
under-determined. The solution to the equation $A x = b$ is found by
computing a vector $x$ that minimizes the Euclidean 2-norm $|| b - A x
||^2$. The polynomials were computed in separate python routines and
resulted in a generated input file. This specifies the vane angle
function within the region of the vanes. This function is then used as
part of the input for the field runs (see Appendix~\ref{sec:archiving}
for more details on the input file environment).

The polynomial order was selected to be 7\textsuperscript{th} because it
provided a good balance between accuracy and a desire to maintain as low
an order as possible. Furthermore, the vanes interpolation was split
into two components, for the ``left'' and ``right'' (from the perspective of a
person standing upwind of the SoV and looking at it) of the vanes in the
top tier. This was found to be the most effective way to ensure that the
polynomial remained accurate without requiring very high order
polynomials. The accuracy of the interpolated field was checked by
``drawing'' vanes by seeding a particle upstream of the field and then
manually integrating it through the field using the scipy integrate ode
packages and verifying visually that the vane had the correct
character. Figures~\ref{fig:top_design} and~\ref{fig:bottom_design} were
generated using this technique.

\section{Turbine Design}
\label{sec:turb_design}

In addition to the final vane design, a turbine design was developed and
tested over a range of design conditions. The design parameters defining
the turbine are listed in Table~\ref{tab:turbine}. The exploration of the
turbine design space was conducted in a manner similar to the
optimization outline detailed in Figure~\ref{fig:opt_image}. The major
design improvements are detailed in Figure~\ref{fig:ut_turbine}. The
``initial guess'' was crude, with flat plate drag polars and a poor
initial guess for the blade angle of $\approx 10^{\circ}$. Later
designs use a higher blade angle often exceeding $40^{\circ}$. 
The design parameters that lead to the largest improvements in power
extracted were changes to the turbine blade geometry (from flat plate to
$180^{\circ}$ half cylinders to $90^{\circ}$ semicircles), optimization
of the blade angle and optimization of the turbine rotation rate. 
However, several other interesting improvements were found in addition to the
principle improvements, and are detailed below. 

  \begin{figure}[!htb]
   \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width = 10 cm]{figs/turbine_opt}
    \caption{Initial turbine optimization before the coupling with the
    frozen flow. The ``initial guess'' was conducted with flat plate
    drag polars at a low blade angle ($\approx
    10^{\circ}$). Subsequent design improvements substantially improved  
    the power extracted, but this list constitutes only a ``greatest
    hits'' and the actual design improvements were highly iterative,
    with numerous runs of a particular parameter configuration yielding
    inferior power output. }
    \label{fig:ut_turbine}
   \end{center}
  \end{figure}

A gap in the center of the turbine was found to favorably reduce turbine
solidity and improve energy extraction. In some cases, this gap was
found to correspond to a mild downward flow as observed in the
fully-developed thermal-only cases detailed in
Section~\ref{sec:thermal_only}. The present simulations do not form a
two-celled vortex, but a gap in the center of the turbine is still
favorable. Similarly, while individual blades are not explicitly
represented in an actuator-disk model, the area of blades is a design
parameter and can be optimized. This is in essence a solidity or
blockage term, with more blades providing more surface area to extract
power from the fluid while simultaneously impeding the flow. A balance
between too much (a blocked off flow) and too little (too little blade
area to extract flow power) must be attained through optimization of the
controlling parameter, $mC$, the product of the number of blades and
each blade's chord length, as detailed in
Section~\label{sec:actuator_disk}. 

Improvements to the turbine power extracted were also attained by adding
``twist''. In other words, the blade angle varies as a function of
radius, i.e. $\beta = \beta(r)$. Our expectation is that the turbine
blades are inside the core vortex. Following our expectation of the
vortex velocity roughly following a Rankene profile, the angular
velocity in the inner core region follows a solid body rotation, 
\begin{equation}
 V_{\theta} = \Omega r . 
\end{equation}
As the torque imposed on the rotor also increases with radius, angular
velocity is increasingly more desirable to extract at larger radius, and
vertical velocity more desirable at smaller radius. Thus, our turbine
blade angle also changes linearly as a function of radius, with
a higher angle at larger radius. 

%Finally, cone improvement
After this initial exploration of the turbine design space, further
investigations were conducted in collaboration with Duane McCormick at
UTRC. This design was arrived at by comparisons between a ``frozen
flow'' optimization routine from UTRC  with the ``fully coupled'' CFD
described previously. This frozen 
flow Matlab code also used an actuator disk model as described in 
Section\ref{sec:actuator_disk}, and required the velocity profiles
immediately upstream of the actuator disk location from runs conducted
with and without the actuator disk present. Thus, the frozen flow
UTRC code was incapable of estimating the impact of a turbine on the
flow, and typically required updated velocity fields from the fully
coupled runs after several iterations. 
The UTRC code was not directly connected to the UT CFD code. Rather,
human intervention was required to prepare the velocity field outputs
from the UT CFD effort so that they could be used in the UTRC
code. Thus, the UTRC code would iterate through design parameters, and
then the CFD code was used as a higher fidelity confirmation. The UTRC
frozen flow optimization was largely consistent with the fully coupled
CFD prediction (see  Figure~\ref{fig:UTRC_turbine}, below). This has
resulted in two final rotor designs, with and without twist. This was
because the experimental team was not certain that a twisted design
would be feasible. Regardless, the twisted rotor was always predicted to 
out-perform the zero-twist rotor.  
The peak power extracted is predicted to be 2.14 kW for the rotor
with twist, and slightly more than 1.51 kW for a rotor with no twist. 
All of these results were conducted with the $90^{\circ}$ circular-arc
airfoil, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:90_drag}. The load on the turbine
is predicted to be modest, at 20 ft-lbs. This indicates that the twisted
rotor design is extracting 44\% of the power from the flow, or a
Betz-efficiency of 75\%, which is consistent with the measured
efficiency of modern wind turbines.

The proposed turbine design is shown in Table~\ref{tab:turbine}. Note
that the design parameter $mC $ is actually the number of blades
multiplied by the chord length. As detailed in
Section~\ref{sec:actuator_disk}, this is the actual parameter of
interest in the actuator disk formulation. For fabrication, this was 
decided to correspond to eight blades with a chord length of 0.45 meters
each. %\todo{discuss twist}

As mentioned previously, the frozen flow and fully coupled CFD
agree. However this is only for rotor loadings close to those in the
coupled CFD. Substantial errors tended to appear in the frozen flow
predictions with parameters far from the coupled CFD. In some cases, the
limitations of the frozen flow optimization were significant. For
instance, the frozen flow model would consistently predict larger power
output at higher RPM. However, several attempts to extract more power at
larger RPMs would cause a breakdown of SoV flow in the coupled CFD
model, which resulted in the flow power dropping by more than an order
of magnitude.%\todo{add turbine flow pictures}

\section{Scenario Parameters}
\label{subsec:scenario_param}

With the system geometry defined, we need only impose the boundary
conditions defined in Section~\label{sec:bc} to have defined our
scenario of interest. However, as with the validation case shown in
Section~\ref{sec:field_val}, significant uncertainty exists in the
scenario parameters that define the ambient thermal and wind
conditions. Some discussion on the scenario parameters is therefore
warranted. 

The thermal boundary layer gradient was set based on data gathered by 
the Georgia Tech team in Arizona on June 9th, 2014. The raw data
presented in Figure~\ref{fig:thermal_profile_fit} is the average from
four vertical temperature profiles take at different times during a
single day. The measurements were gathered between 9:49 am and 1:43
pm\cite{ann_comm}.  

A particular challenge is that the closest measurement was taken by a 
thermocouple 1 mm above the pavement. Thus, the surface temperature and
magnitude of thermal gradient were not directly measured. To estimate
$T_0$ and $\Delta T$, the thermal profile was fit with a least squares
minimization of the residual between Equation~\ref{eq:bl_t} and to the
existing experimental data. The resulting profile is plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:thermal_profile_fit}. The sparsity of existing
experimental data near the surface is quite clear from this
profile. The fitted profile is then evaluated at $x=0$ to determine the
ground temperature. Based on this criterion, a difference of 30 Kelvin was
selected.   

 \begin{figure}[!htb]
  \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width = 15 cm]{figs/fit_zoomed}
   \caption{The raw thermal boundary layer data (blue circles) plotted
   against the fitted boundary layer profile (red triangles). The
   paucity of experimental data undermines the fit's accuracy to
   anything more than a plausible location for the actual wall
   temperature. }  
   \label{fig:thermal_profile_fit}
  \end{center}
 \end{figure}

In addition to the thermal profile, the incoming wind velocity needed an 
estimate. Thankfully, wind measurements were performed by the
experimental team in the field also during the June, 2014 test. A single 
hour time series was captured for both day and night as measured by the
sonic anemometers. These data series are plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:wind_speed_estimate}. The wind speed was sampled at a
sampling rate of 0.5 Hz, and the traces were plotted for one hour (for
both the day and night). 

 \begin{figure}[!htb]
  \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{figs/wind_measurements}
   \caption{Wind Speed Measurements from the June 2014 field test.}
   \label{fig:wind_speed_estimate}
  \end{center}
 \end{figure}

Several observations can be made from this data. There is essentially no
mean flow at night, but during the day the winds are not insignificant,
with a mean velocity of about two meters per second and fluctuations of
nearly six meters per second. It is clear that the wind profile is
turbulent.  Also note that the daytime wind does not die out: the
average horizontal velocity during the day is about 2-3 m/sec. 

The wind direction was also monitored, and showed little variation. 
This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:wind_direction}. It was therefore
assumed that the wind had a constant heading and constant speed during
the simulations. Furthermore, discussions with the field team indicated
that wind heading over several years of field tests were relatively
consistent. This was part of the motivation for the movement to an
asymmetric vane configuration, as if the wind direction changed daily
(for instance) it would render an asymmetric design useless, unless it
could easily be manipulated to align with the free stream velocity.

\end{figure}

The velocity and temperature fields resulting from the 2016 field test 
simulations are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:field_hor} and
~\ref{fig:field_vert}, below. Generally speaking, the fields have
complicated, non-trivial structure. The majority of the flow is driven
into the vanes by the ambient upstream winds, where it accelerates due
to the contraction of the vanes towards the center of the SoV.
The vertical slices in Figure~\ref{fig:field_vert} clearly depict a
strong vertical velocity in the center of the device. This vertical
plume coincides with a coherent, high temperature ``thermal plume'', as
well as a region of intense rotation and azimuthal velocity. This flow
is driven upward where it flows past the turbine and out of the top of
the device. 

From the horizontal viewpoint shown in Figure~\ref{fig:field_hor}, it is
clear that the streamwise velocity has a complicated structure. The
vertical velocity is largely a circular plume that has expanded to fill
the cylindrical inner region of the turbine vanes. Unlike in the
thermal-only cases, no downward flow exists, and there is no formation
of a two-celled vortex. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{figs/field_streamlines}
  \label{fig:field_stream}
 \caption{Fluid entrainment through and around the apparatus. This was
 drawn by seeding particles into the flowfield and then advancing them

 is shown to provide a sense of scale. The bottom left corner is the
 upwind direction. While a majority of the flow is coming from upstream
 of the device, a substantial portion of the flow is nevertheless
 entrained from the leeward side of the SoV. }  
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:field_stream} shows tracing particles advanced forward
and backward in time from the center of the device. This clearly shows
that the flow is drawn in from both the front and back of the SoV, and
that the device is entraining air from a region far larger than the SoV
vane diameter.  While a majority of the flow is coming from upstream of
the device, a substantial portion of the flow is nevertheless  entrained
from the leeward side of the SoV. Most of the entrained flow from
downstream of the vanes comes from a narrower region than the upstream,
and appears to be constrained to the wake of the SoV. It is also
interesting to note that most of the backflow from downwind side occurs
very near the surface. While most of the radial inflow to the SoV is
from the downside side is near the surface, the vortex is strong enough
to entrain flow from outside the vanes above the device. 

The 2016 field configuration has 4.77 kW of kinetic energy flux through
the top of the vanes, taken from a plane just below the turbine, which
is 608\% more kinetic energy flux than the peak measurement produced in
the August 2015 Field test.  

\subsection{Sources of Error}
\label{sec:field_error}
%
%behaves like wind tunnel contraction
While these results are promising, there are several significant
shortcomings to these models and scenario conditions that substantially
impact the SoV performance. 

A major uncertainty is the opacity of the device. Ideally, the device
would be completely transparent. However, previous field tests
found that the SoV footprint resulted in shading in the inner region of
the vanes, which resulted in a lower temperature inside the device than
in the immediate region. As the physical trigger for the SoV is
initiated by thermal buoyancy, this necessarily greatly reduces the
velocities inside the device, and so the kinetic energy flux and power
extracted by the turbine. For instance, simulations performed where the
surface inside the region of the vanes was set to the ambient air
temperature (an admittedly ``worst-case scenario'') found that the
energy extracted by the turbine was reduced to only 800 Watts. Thus,
consistent with the results shown in Section~\ref{sec:wind_impact}, the
absence of a thermal to drive the flow reduces the available kinetic
energy flux (and thus, the power extracted by the turbine) by more than
half. 

%Scenario Uncertainty!!!!!!!!!!!

%Actuator disk under-estimates drag

%no model for drag on vanes (was reported by team)

%wind heading adjustments and measurements of flux reduction

No dynamics in the wind were considered, with only a steady,
non-zero mean wind velocity. It may well be that even in the "thermal
only" cases there could be significant, zero mean turbulence (perhaps
like grid turbulence) contributing from the ambient
surroundings. However, crude sensitivity analyses were performed by
adjusting the mean velocity of the wind by  $\pm 1 \text{m}/\text{s}$,
which indicated that the power generated by the turbine only increases
with higher wind velocity, and that most of the vortex structure and
character of the solution discussed in
Section~\ref{subsec:field_predict} remains true, with only modestly
reduced velocities. 

%It is also possible that a substantial transient may exist during which
%the SoV 

A June field test in 2016 reported only modest velocities through the
prototype apparatus.
While substantial, the uncertainties describe above are not significant
enough to account for the weakness of observed flow, indicating a
potentially significant model uncertainty that had previously not been
considered. The subsequent sections detail two possible modeling
inadequacy components that were investigated in detail, and may account
for the significantly reduced flow observed in the field. 

\section{Turning Vane Drag}

The first model correction proposed is to introduce drag along the
turning vanes to account for the skin friction along the surface. To
introduce a force of parasitic drag, the turning vane forcing 
representation described in Section~\ref{subsec:vane} need only be
modified to introduce an additional force that acts in opposition of the
fluid velocity. Thus, in addition to forcing the flow to align with the
vane surface, the flow will also be slowed. The vane formulation now
acts in a dissipative manner, and is not energy conserving. 

Our unit forcing vector $\hat f$ is simply the negative normalized inner
product of the velocity, $u$, and the turning vane tangent vector $\hat
t$,  
\begin{equation}
- \frac{u \cdot \hat t}{|| u \cdot \hat t ||} = \hat f. 
\end{equation}
The volumetric force applied is, 
\begin{equation}
 F = \hat f \, C_f \, \frac{1}{2} \frac{\rho || u ||^2}{\delta}
\end{equation}
Where $C_f$ is the skin friction coefficient (which must be determined),
$\rho $ is the density and $\delta$ the channel half width. 
For $C_f$, we use Dean's Correlation\cite{johnson1998handbook},

Where the Reynolds number is defined as, 
\begin{equation}
 Re = \frac{u\, \delta}{\nu}.
\end{equation}

Some roughness elements exist across the vanes. In addition to
non-smooth surface materials, the design of the field test apparatus
ultimately relied upon posts to hold the turning vanes. These posts were
pieces of wood which were modeled as roughness elements. In order to
determine $C_f$ for these cases, the Colebrook formula\cite{Colebrook367},
% Colebrook, C. F.; White, C. M. (3 August 1937). "Experiments with

was used to provide an estimate for the friction factor given a
roughness height, $\epsilon/D$,  
\begin{equation}
 \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}} = -2.0 \text{ log}\left(\frac{\epsilon/D}{3.7} + \frac{2.51}{Re\sqrt(f)}\right).
\end{equation}
 With the assumption that for large roughness the Reynolds number term
 contribution is not significant, the function is no longer implicit in
 $f$ and can be determined directly, 
\begin{equation}
 f = \left(2.0 \text{ log}\left(\frac{\epsilon/D}{3.7}\right)\right)^2. 
\end{equation}
%Then, a Moody chart was consulted to provide the the 
Note that D here is the hydraulic diameter which must account for the
two plates (we treat the vanes as a channel),
\begin{equation}
D_H = \frac{4 A}{P} = \frac{4 (2w)\delta}{2w} = 4 \delta
\end{equation}
Where $\delta$ is the channel half width, or in our case, the distance
between the vanes. To construct a ``worst-case'' scenario, we consider
the smallest distance between the vanes, which occurs near the center of
the SoV. Furthermore, we consider roughness heights based on a
two-by-four (which were used as supports for the
vanes). Even for this worst case scenario, the velocities on the vanes
are not substantially reduced with the addition of the drag model. The
flow field kinetic energy flux was never reduced more than 12\%. 
This crude model indicates that the reduced flows observed during the
June 2016 field tests are not attributable to skin friction drag on the
turning vanes.  


\subsection{Blade Solidity Modification}
\label{sec:solidity}
%
%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_solidity
%
It was noted that wind turbines typically possess three blades, versus
the eight blades used in the 2016 field test. This is therefore a
substantially increased turbine solidity versus common engineering
designs. It is expected that we are operating in a regime not common to
typical actuator disk models. 

The power output of a turbine is proportional to the thrust that it
exerts onto the flow, and the larger the thrust, the larger the flow
resistance the turbine presents to the flow. The maximum power for any
wind turbine must lie in between two extremes, i.e. high and
a low impedance both result in minimal power
extraction\cite{solidity_oxford}.  

For the case of high impedance, little fluid flows through the
turbine and instead flows around the device. This gives the appearance of
the turbine being ``blocked''. In the case of low impedance, the turbine
hardly affects the flow, and less power is extracted than could be. 

Thus, an ``efficient'' impedance to the flow is one that strikes the 
right balance between solidity and tip speed ratio. If the solidity is
high, the operating tip speed ratio must be lower to avoid too high an
impedance. 

However, it is hard to predict the precise effects of the various
phenomena, which is why it is difficult to comment on the overall
performance of a particular machine in a specific
scenario. %Turbine design is highly specialized for 

However, the actuator disk model treats the flow in the disk region as
if it was flowing through a rotor with identical solidity but an
infinite number of blades. A model correction was introduced that
attempts to represent the fact that as the number of turbine blades
increases, the pressure across the actuator disk should rise. This is
accomplished by adjusting the area of the actuator disk down by the
ratio of the free area in the disk versus the blade sizes. 

%A second model correction was therefore introduced with the aim of attempting to
%discern if the turbine 


% too high an impedance
%This has several important implications.  

%A low tip speed ratio implies increased torque, requiring a larger
%and higher cost gearbox. In addition, the lower the tip speed ratio, the
%higher the maximum angle of attack, which can be problematic with regard
%to blade stalling. 

%
% howevr, it is hard
%

%When applied to a rotor with a finite number of blades, 


The length of each blade blocking vertical flow in the actuator disk is, 
\begin{equation}
  Ch * \text{Cos}(\beta(r)) = Ch_x(r). 
\end{equation}
The total length in an annular region that is blocking is therefore,
\begin{equation}
  N * Ch_x(r) = l_B(r),
\end{equation}
Where N is the number of blades. 
Then, the ratio of an annular length that is impeded by blades is, 
\begin{eqnarray}
 B(r) =& \frac{2\pi r- l_B(r)}{2 \pi r}\\
 B(r) =& 1- \frac{l_B(r)}{2 \pi r}. 
\end{eqnarray}
Note that a ``floor'' function is needed to ensure the solidity ratio
does not go below zero. 

For a 1D control volume analysis for the region, the continuity
equation is, 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \rho V_z' A' =& \rho V_z A,\\
 V_z' =& V_z \frac{A}{A'}, \\
 V_z' =& \frac{V_z}{B(r)}.
\end{eqnarray}
This implies that $V_z' \rightarrow \infty$ as $A' \rightarrow
0$. This is as expected, as the blockage becomes more severe, the flow
would need to move at greater speed to go through it. 

The flow angle with respect to turbine velocity is therefore modified 
from Equation~\ref{eq:fan_direction} in
Section~\ref{sec:actuator_disk},
\begin{equation}
 \theta_f = \text{tan}^{-1}(\frac{U_{\text{up}}}{U_{\text{fwd}}})
\end{equation}
to,
\begin{equation}
 \theta_f = \text{tan}^{-1}(\frac{U_{\text{up}}}{B(r) U_{\text{fwd}}}). 
\end{equation}
As $B(r) \rightarrow 0$, $\theta_f \rightarrow \pi$, e.g. 90 degrees. In
this way the velocity vector will be completely aligned with drag. 

Furthermore Equation~\ref{eq:force_turb}, 
\begin{equation}
 F = \frac{1}{2}\frac{c \rho U_p^2}{A}(C_L \cdot n_{\text{lift}} + C_d
  \cdot n_{\text{drag}})
\end{equation}
is modified so that, 
\begin{equation}
 \bar U_p^{2} = \left(\frac{U_p}{B(r)}\right)^2
\end{equation}

This turbine modification for solidity has a significant impact on the
power extracted by the turbine. A comparison between the number of
turbine blades and the power generated by the turbine for both the
baseline turbine and the turbine with the solidity modification is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:turbine_solidity}. The results are quite consistent with
two blades, show a notable inconsistency at four blades, and completely
diverge at higher blade count. 
%Only even number of blades were
%considered due to the expectation that 

  \begin{figure}[!htb]
   \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width = 10 cm]{figs/solidity}
    \caption{The power extracted by the turbine as a function of blade
    count. The blue straight line indicates the turbine model as defined
    in Section~\ref{sec:actuator_disk}, and the red dashed line
    indicates the power output of the turbine after the solidity
    modification.}
    \label{fig:turbine_solidity}
   \end{center}
  \end{figure}

This model modification indicates that the prior prediction of eight
turbine blades in Section~\ref{sec:turb_design} was too large. Instead,
a turbine with substantially reduced solidity is preferred. Based on
Figure~\ref{fig:turbine_solidity}, a turbine with similar
characteristics in terms of length, location and twist but reduced from
eight blades to four or two blades is expected to mitigate the
substantially reduced performance observed in the field. 

This crude model is admittedly extreme, as it effectively models the
blades as flat plate bluff bodies, with the flow completely
separated on the leeward side. Ideally, the flow should be smoothly
turning through the blading, and not separate. Thus, it is possible that
this estimate is overly pessimistic. Regardless, this is the only model
correction that was explored that is plausibly capable of explaining the
2016 field observations noted in Section~\ref{sec:field_error}. 

Interesting enough, there have been actuator disk models used with wind
turbines that indicate operating at low tip speed ratios with high
solidity ratios would possess power coefficients close to Betz-like
limits of efficiency\cite{WE:WE118}. It is therefore possible that the
actuator disk model is generally unsuited for high solidity regimes, and
that the correction presented here is more generally useful.

\section{Estimating the Upper Limit on Power Extraction}
\label{sec:peak_estimate}

All of the results in Section~\ref{subsec:field_predict} were generated
using $90^{\circ}$ semicircle blade geometries, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:90_drag}. The only other blade geometries considered were the
flat plate and $180^{\circ}$ arcs, which were universally found to be
inferior. Time constraints required fabrication of the turbine in short
order, and a limited budget encouraged inexpensive (and therefore
simple) turbine blades. Finally, the design space was limited to
readily available drag polar data due to the expense and difficulty of 
fabricating non-standard turbine blades. Risk mitigation also played a
role, with an emphasis on traditional, and therefore well-vetted turbine
blade design. %While several comparisons have been performed with
%different choices of turbine blades (flat plate, 180 degree semicircles,
%etc. ) this was not an exhaustive survey. 
%Nevertheless, this is not an exhaustive exploration of turbine
%blade design, and the question remains, ``Could more power be extracted
%with a different rotor geometry?''. 
This section details an additional computational research program
performed after the turbine fabrication with the intent of estimating
the upper limit of power extraction with an idealized turbine. 

Practical utility-scale wind turbines achieve at peak 75\% to 80\% of
the Betz limit\cite{burton2001wind}. The Betz-limit states a theoretical
maximum of 59\% of the wind's power may be captured. Therefore,
practical wind turbines extract less than half of the available kinetic
energy flux. 
Comparing the kinetic energy flux of simulations without the turbine to
the power extracted by the turbine, we note that our simulations
typically predict power extraction ratios slightly less than fifty
percent, indicating that our efforts are not significantly better or
worse than could be expected. While this provides an estimate, the
Betz-limit is likely not accurate for this case. Any analysis of the
power that can be extracted is complicated by the presence of
considerable vertical and azimuthal flow in the vortex, and so the
design considerations are different from those for a classical wind
turbine.  

The objective then, is to formulate a more generalized approach to the
turbine vane parameters to permit an optimization that is not
constrained to a particular turbine blade geometry. Rather, this
approach seeks to estimate the upper limit of power extracted. The
rationale behind this is to provide an upper bound on the power that can 
be extracted for a particular configuration, which can then be used as
input for feasibility considerations of the SoV.  

It is desirable to perform these estimates within the context of the
actuator disk model (see Section~\ref{sec:actuator_disk}). While
actuator disk models are commonly
optimized\cite{790585,WE:WE487,en5093425,adkins1983design}, the lift and 
drag polars are not parameters that are varied in these schemes. Rather,
a given blade geometry is assumed and then the rotation rate, blade
angle and chord length (for instance) are optimized.   

Conversely, airfoil optimization is a rich field with sophisticated and
well-vetted
techniques~\cite{drela1998pros,lewis2001aerodynamic,Chehouri2015361},
but these methods do not use an actuator disk model, and focus on the
shape optimization of the airfoil geometry (and through this, the lift
and drag polars).  

To address the possibility of further turbine blade
improvements, while continuing to use an abstract actuator disk model,
%while simultaneously not representing the blade geometry
%proper
this section details a formulation for a generic set of drag 
polars. These generalized drag polars permit exploration of a broader
design space. The optimization of this model can be fully coupled to the
flow, and so does not violate any Betz-like considerations that might
similarly arise in an analysis of frozen flow fields.
The drag polars are selected to be generic functions and are optimized to
maximize the power extracted by the rotor. While the resulting drag
polars might not be physically  realizable, they represent a ``best
case'' upper bound indicating the peak power that might be extracted
with further rotor design iterations. This ``limiting case'' is useful
for evaluating the system feasibility from a technological standpoint,
by providing the peak power that could be extracted for a given vane
geometry. 

The power extracted by the turbine is, 
\begin{equation}
 P = \Omega \, Q
\end{equation}
where the torque, Q, is\cite{morgado2014validation}, 
\begin{equation}
 Q = A_R \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} F''_{\tau}\, r\, dr d\theta.
\end{equation}
Here, $A_R$ is the relative area coefficient which is, 
\begin{equation}
A_R = \frac{c B (r_{\text{max}}-r_{\text{min}})}{\pi(r_{\text{max}}^2-r_{\text{min}}^2)}
\end{equation}
where B is the number of blades, $r_{\text{max}}$ and $r_{\text{min}}$
are the turbine radii, and $F''_{\tau}$ is the force per unit
area on the turbine, which is, 
\begin{equation}
 F''_{\tau} = \frac{F_{\tau}}{cl}= \frac{1}{2}\rho U_R^2 \, C_{\tau}.
\end{equation}
with $U_R$ the magnitude of relative velocity and $c$ is the blade chord
length, which is assumed to be constant (not a function of the radius,
for instance). Finally, $C_{\tau}$ is the tangential force coefficient,
which depends on the local lift and drag coefficients, and the
flow angle, $\phi$, 
\begin{equation}
 C_{\tau} = C_L \,\text{sin}(\phi) + C_D \,\text{cos}(\phi)
\end{equation}
Combining the equations above results in an expression for the power
that explicitly depends on the lift and drag coefficients, 
\begin{equation*}
 P = \frac{\Omega \rho c B (r_{\text{max}}-r_{\text{min}})}{2 \pi(r_{\text{max}}^2-r_{\text{min}}^2)}
\int_0^{2\pi}
\int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} U_R(r,\theta,\Omega)^2 \left(C_L
						     \,\text{sin}(\phi)
						     + C_D
						     \,\text{cos}(\phi)
						    \right) r\,dr d\theta. 
\end{equation*}
We lump the constant terms together, 
\begin{equation}
E_{\tau} = \frac{\Omega \rho c B (r_{\text{max}}-r_{\text{min}})}{2
 \pi(r_{\text{max}}^2-r_{\text{min}}^2)}
\end{equation}
 and separate this equation, 
\begin{align}
 P_L = E_\tau
 \int_0^{2\pi}
  \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} U_R(r,\theta,\Omega)^2 \, C_L(\phi,r)
 \,\text{sin}(\phi)\, r\,dr d\theta,  \label{lift} \\
 P_D = E_\tau
 \int_0^{2\pi}
  \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} U_R(r,\theta,\Omega)^2 \, C_D(\phi,r) \,\text{cos}(\phi)\, r\,dr d\theta. \label{drag}
\end{align}
Note that we have assumed $C_D = C_D(\phi,r)$ and $C_L = C_L(\phi,r)$,
namely, that the coefficients vary with the flow direction and may vary
radially, due to twisting the blade angle. Furthermore, the flow
direction, $\phi$, varies with the location and the blade speed,
in that $\phi=\phi(r,\theta,\Omega)$. The relative velocity is the
quantity, $U_R = U - U_\tau$, e.g. the difference in velocity between
the turbine and the flow. The turbine has no axial velocity ($w_\tau =
0$) and a constant rotation speed, and so the two components of velocity
in the plane of rotation can be expressed as,
\begin{align}
 u_\tau = \Omega \,r\, \text{sin}(\theta)\\
 v_\tau = \Omega \,r\, \text{cos}(\theta)
\end{align}

Our objective is now to discover what these unknown functions of lift
and drag are. To do this, we specify an optimization problem such that, 
\begin{equation*} 
 \text{Max } P(C_L,C_D) \quad \text{ subject to: }
  \begin{cases}
   |C_L| < C_L^{\text{Max}}, \\
   0 < C_D < C_D^{\text{Max}}. \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

In words, the drag must be specified to be greater than zero, but
the lift can be negative. This is a problem in the calculus of
variations, where the objective is to maximize a
functional subject to imposed
constraints~\cite{thornton2004classical,bradbury1968theoretical,2015JFM...784..565S}.   

%
% does this argument still work?!?
%
The integral shown in Equation \ref{lift} above can be bounded by 
Schwarz's inequality,  
\begin{align*}
  \left[
    \int_0^{2\pi}
    \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} C_L(\phi,r)\, U_R(r,\theta,\Omega)^2
 \,\text{sin}(\phi)\, r\,dr d\theta \right]^2 \le \\
  \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} C_L^2(\phi,r) dr d\theta\,
  \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} U_R(r,\theta,\Omega)^4 
 \,\text{sin}^2(\phi)\, r^2\,dr d\theta.
\end{align*}

In this way the first integral quantity,
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^{2\pi}
 \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} C_L^2(\phi,r) dr d\theta, 
\end{equation}
is clearly maximized when $C_L(\phi,r) = C_L^{\text{max}}$. 
The result for Equation \ref{drag} is identical. Now, for these
conditions, we are interested in largest attainable values. For the drag
coefficient, $C_D^{\text{Max}}$ is two. % refmunson 
This corresponds to a flat plate perpendicular to the flow.
The lift coefficient peak is about 1.75. This design is not necessarily
physically realizable, but represents an absolute maximum. 

Therefore, our lift/drag functions may be expressed as,
\begin{align*} 
 C_D(\phi) = \bar C_D \, \psi(\phi) 
  \begin{cases}
   \psi(\phi) = 1 \text{ if sin}(\phi) > 0,   \\
   0 \text{ else} \\
  \end{cases} \\
 C_L(\phi) = \bar C_L \, \Psi(\phi) 
  \begin{cases}
   \Psi(\phi) = 1 \text{ if cos}(\phi) > 0,   \\
   -1 \text{ else}. \\
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
Where $\bar C_L = 1.7$ and $\bar C_D = 2.0$. The plot of these drag
polars are shown in Figure \ref{drags}.

    \caption{The uncalibrated idealized drag polars.} 
    \label{drags}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

%Thus, the drag polars
%have the form, 
%\begin{align*} 
% &C_L(\phi) = 
%  \begin{cases}
%    1.75& \quad 0^{\circ} \le \phi \le 180^{\circ}, \\
%   -1.75& \quad 180^{\circ} \le \phi \le 360^{\circ}.  \\
%  \end{cases}\\
% &C_D(\phi) = 
%  \begin{cases}
%    2.0& \quad -90^{\circ} \le \phi \le 90^{\circ}, \\
%      0& \quad 90^{\circ} \le \phi \le 270^{\circ}.  \\
%  \end{cases}\\
%\end{align*}

Under this approach, the turbine extracts so much energy from the flow
that the vortex loses its coherence and the power extracted becomes
negative (e.g. the constant velocity turbine is adding energy to the
flow). %\todo{add image}
This implies a limit on how much of the energy can be extracted before
disrupting the flow so greatly that the vortex cannot be maintained.   
Consistent with the results from Section~\ref{sec:field_error},
the vortex is not robust, and the feedback from extracting more power
from it (manifest as increased blade solidity) causes a collapse of the
vortex structure. It is interesting to note that the vortex collapse is
not subtle, with the power extracted discontinuously dropping to zero or
negative values. 

To withdraw from the vortex disruption point, the drag
polars are calibrated by reducing $\bar C_L $ and $\bar C_D$ so that the 
vortex does not dissipate and the power extracted remains positive. The
parameters were adjusted by hand, so the calibration is crude. The
optimal parameters found were $\bar C_L = 1.1$ and $\bar C_D = 1.5$. It
is interesting to note that this is nearly the average of the drag
polars shown in Figures~\ref{fig:flat_plate_drag},~\ref{fig:semi_drag}, 
and\ref{fig:90_drag}. The solution flow in the case of the idealized
turbine remains similar to the results shown in
Section~\ref{subsec:field_predict}, and so are not depicted here. 

The steady state power extracted by the ideal turbine 
increased from the previous best attained with the 90 degree
semicircles, to 2.76 kW. It is interesting to note that this is 58\% of
the available kinetic energy flux measured just upstream of the turbine,
indicating that the turbine is very close to the Betz-limit of
59.3\%. While as indicated previously, the Betz-limit is likely to be
inaccurate for rotating flows, it is nevertheless interesting that the
idealized turbine would extract power so close to the maximum predicted by
Betz.  This provides a weak limit (even under these idealized
conditions) bounding the power that can be derived from this
flow. Furthermore, this indicates that previous estimates of the power
that might be extracted from the flow are not greatly limited by the
present turbine design. This is an important element of the system
feasibility assessment, as it provides evidence against the turbine
being a source of considerable inefficiency.
