\section{Geometry}

The steady reduced order model (ROM) was used to explore a broad set of
system configurations and to optimize kinetic energy flux. The resulting
configuration represents a significant change from that used in the
August 2015 Field test. Horizontal and vertical views of this
configuration are shown in Figures \ref{a-b}, below. A brief summary of
the differences is given below: 

\begin{itemize}
\item The bottom tier vanes are significantly taller than in the field.
\item An impermeable cylinder was introduced along the arc $\{\pi < \theta
      < 0 \}$, e.g. the bottom two quadrants in the images below, replacing the
vanes in those quadrants. 
\item The cone is taller providing a greater contraction.
\item The bottom tier vanes are no longer symmetric: the downwind side is
taller because the downwind boundary layer is thicker and has a lower
peak turning angle to reduce blockage.
\item The upper tier vanes were configured to align with the freestream
velocity, to provide a larger wind-driven flux into the facility.
\item Horizontal partitions were added to the top of the upper vanes, to
prevent flow in the vanes from rising up and out of the vanes. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Turning Vane Interpolation Functions}

The top tier design is now highly asymmetric, with a
large opening facing the incoming wind to capture incoming free stream
kinetic energy over a large area. The incoming flow enters the central
cylindrical area, where it spins and is driven out the top through the
cone. 

To enable these more general vane geometries for the top tier, it was
necessary to formulate a more general parameterization of the
vanes.\todo{why did we need to do this?} 

Previously, the vanes had a linear curvature function and were
axisymmetric. The new concept required the vanes to hold an azimuthal
dependence so that they are aligned with the streamwise velocity upsteam 
of the device, and then curve inward to spin the flow at the center of
the device. A linear vane curvature was first attempted, but this was
found to have too few degrees of freedom to provide adjustments to the
vane curvature. Next, vanes that had an elliptic curvature were decided
upon. The intent here is to have a quarter of an ellipse, where the arc
of the ellipse starts at the x-intercept (thus ensuring the vane is
aligned with the freestream velocity) and then curves in towards the
center of the device, terminating at a high angle nearly azimuthal. To
accomplish this, the normal vector of the ellipse must be known. 

This required use of implicit differentiation for the functional,

\begin{eqnarray}
 f(x,y)  =& \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1, \\
 \nabla f(x,y) =& \frac{2 (x-h)}{a^2} + \frac{2 (y-k)}{b^2}\frac{dy}{dx} = 0, \\
 \frac{dy}{dx} =& -\frac{(x-h)}{(y-k)}\frac{b^2}{a^2}. 
\end{eqnarray}
Where h and k are the elliptic intercepts and a and b are the
eccentricity of the ellipse along each axis. The tangent vector along
the ellipse is then,  
\begin{eqnarray}
 %{\bf \hat t} = {\bf e_x} + \frac{dy}{dx}{\bf e_y}, \\
 {\bf t} =& {\bf e_x} + \frac{dy}{dx}{\bf e_y}, \\
 {\bf t} =& \underbrace{\frac{(y-k)}{b^2}}_{a_y} {\bf e_x} -
  \underbrace{\frac{(x-h)}{a^2}}_{a_x}{\bf e_y} \\
 {\bf t} =& {a_y} {\bf e_x} - {a_x}{\bf e_y}. 
\end{eqnarray}

Noting that the normal vector has the form, 
\begin{eqnarray}
 {\bf n} =& {a_x} {\bf e_x} + {a_y}{\bf e_y}, \label{eqn:a_x}\\
 {\bf n} =& \frac{(x-h)}{a^2} {\bf e_x} + \frac{(y-k)}{b^2} {\bf e_y}.
\end{eqnarray}

This now defines the normal vector. However, we need to determine the 
constants (namely, $k,b$) that define ellipses that capture the shape we
desire. We want to determine an ellipse that has a certain
slope, m, at a specific point,  $(x_0,y_o)$, which lies on the inner
radius (R) of the SoV apparatus. This is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:elliptic_vane_concept}. We have a system of four
equations,
\begin{eqnarray}
 \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} =& 1, \\
 \frac{(x_0-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y_0-k)^2}{b^2} =& 1, \\
 x_0^2 + y_0^2 =& R, \\
 -\frac{b^2}{a^2}\frac{(x_0-h)}{(y_0-k)} =& m. 
\end{eqnarray}
These equations express the fact that the ellipse intercepts both known
points, that the point $(x_0,y_o)$ lies on the inner radius of the
apparatus, and that the slope at this point is known. Assuming that
h, a, x, y, R and m are given, we have a system of four equations (the
above) with four unknowns, $x_0,y_0,k,b$. This is, in principle,
sufficient information to solve this system. However, in practice, great
difficulties arise. Inverting this system by hand is too complex and
error prone, and furthermore, Mathematica was unable to find a
closed-form solution. Numerous simplifications and additional
constraints were added to ensure that the system of equations were
well-posed (a>b, for instance), but the problem still resisted a
solution. 

 \begin{figure}[!htb]
  \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width =0.95\textwidth]{figs/elliptic_vane_concept}
   \caption{The geometric problem for the elliptic vanes.}
   \label{fig:elliptic_vane_concept}
  \end{center}
 \end{figure}

The problem then, is that for a given location $(x,y)$ in space we are
unable to invert to determine the character of the ellipse that
intersects that point. Instead, we can pose the problem as discretizing
the arc along the inner radius of the vanes, we can generate data from
several curves that can be used to calibrate a 2D polynomial that will
smoothly vary in space. To accomplish this, we choose a series of
$x_0,y_0$ curves. For each unique ellipse defined by ($x_0,y_0,b,a,k$),
discretize at a uniform interval between $\left[-h,x_0\right]$, and
solve for the accompanying y-value, 
\begin{equation}
 y = -b \sqrt{1-\frac{(x-h)}{a^2}} + k. 
\end{equation}
One now has sufficient information to solve for the normal coefficients
$a_x$ and $a_y$ as defined in Equation~\ref{eqn:a_x}. This array of
coefficients specified at (x,y) are now fit to a 2D N\textsuperscript{th}
order polynomial. This has the form, 

\begin{equation}
 P(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^N  \sum_{j=0}^N a_{i,j} x^i y^j
\end{equation}

where $a_{i,j}$ are coefficients of the polynomial which are selected by
minimizing the residual between the specified vane values and the
polynomial evaluated at that point. In other words, we find the
least-squares solution to a linear matrix equation, which is
under-determined. The solution to the equation $A x = b$ is found by
computing a vector $x$ that minimizes the Euclidean 2-norm $|| b - A x
||^2$. The polynomials were computed in separate python routines and
resulted in a generated input file. This specifies the vane angle
function within the region of the vanes. This function is then used as
part of the input for the field runs (see Appendix~\ref{sec:archiving}
for more details on the input file environment).

The polynomial order was selected to be 7\textsuperscript{th} because it
provided a good balance between accuracy and a desire to maintain as low
an order as possible. Furthermore, the vanes interpolation was split
into two components, for the ``left'' and ``right'' (from the perspective of a
person standing upwind of the SoV and looking at it) of the vanes in the
top tier. The ``right'' interpolated field is shown in

\section{Turbine Design}

  \begin{figure}[!htb]

    \caption{Turbine optimization}
    \label{fig:ut_turbine}
   \end{center}
  \end{figure}

In addition to the final vane design, a turbine design developed in
collaboration with Duane McCormick at UTRC. This design was arrived at
by coupling a ``frozen flow'' optimization routine from UTRC with a Blade
Element Momentum (BEM) rotor model integrated into UT's CFD model as an
actuator disk. The rotor/inflow coupling directly modeled enabling
accurate rotor inflow predictions. In this way, the UTRC code would
iterate through design parameters using the coupled CFD code as a higher
fidelity confirmation. The UTRC frozen flow optimization was largely
consistent with the fully coupled CFD prediction (see
Figure~\ref{fig:UTRC_turbine}, below). This has resulted in two final
rotor designs, with and without twist. This was because the experimental
team was not certain that a twisted design would be
feasible. Regardless, the twisted rotor out-performed the zero-twist
rotor. The peak power extracted is predicted to be 1.4 kW for the rotor
with twist, and slightly more than 1 kW for a rotor with no twist. 

  \begin{figure}[!htb]
   \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width = 10 cm]{figs/utrc_plot}
    \caption{The power extracted by the rotor predicted by the CFD (red
    circles) and ``frozen flow'' (blue line) for a range of rotor
    collective angles. The higher lines are for blades with twist, and
    the lower are for constant blade angle runs, which was always
    inferior in terms of power extracted.}
    \label{fig:UTRC_turbine}
   \end{center}
  \end{figure}


In general, the frozen flow and fully coupled CFD agree. However this is
only for rotor loadings close to those in the coupled CFD. The errors
tend to be in frozen flow predictions with parameters far from the
coupled CFD. In some cases, the limitations of the frozen flow
optimization were significant. For instance, several attempts
to extract more power at large RPMs would cause a breakdown of SoV
flow in the coupled CFD model, which resulted in the flow power dropping
by more than an order of magnitude.\todo{add turbine flow pictures}

\section{Field Prediction}
\label{subsec:field_predict}

With the system geometry defined, we need only impose the boundary
conditions defined in Section~\label{sec:bc} to have defined our
scenario of interest. However, as with the validation case shown in
Section~\ref{sec:field_val}, significant uncertainty exists in the
scenario parameters that define the ambient thermal and wind
conditions. Some discussion on the scenario parameters is therefore
warranted. 

The thermal boundary layer gradient was set based on data gathered by 
the Georgia Tech team in Arizona on June 9th, 2014. The raw data
presented in Figure~\ref{fig:thermal_profile_fit} is the average from
four vertical temperature profiles take at different times during a
single day. The measurements were gathered between 9:49 am and 1:43
pm\cite{ann_comm}.  

A particular challenge is that the closest measurement was taken by a 
thermocouple 1 mm above the pavement. Thus, the surface temperature and
magnitude of thermal gradient were not directly measured. To estimate
$T_0$ and $\Delta T$ from Equation~\ref{eq:bl_t},\todo{finish this}

The optimized configuration for this case results in 3.05 kW of kinetic
energy flux through the top of the vanes, which is 417\% more kinetic
energy flux than was produced in the August 2015 Field test.

Our unit forcing vector $\hat f$ is the normalized inner product of the 
velocity, $u$, and the tangent vector $\hat t$, 
\begin{equation}
- \frac{u \cdot \hat t}{|| u \cdot \hat t ||} = \hat f. 
\end{equation}

The force applied is then, 
\begin{equation}
 F = \hat f \, C_f \, \frac{1}{2} \frac{\rho || u ||^2}{\delta}

Where $C_f$ is the skin friction coefficient (which must be determined),

Some roughness elements existed across the vanes. In addition to
non-smooth surface materials, the design of the field test apparatus
ultimately relied upon posts to hold the turning vanes. These posts were
pieces of wood which were modeled as roughness elements. In order to
determine $C_f$ for these cases, the Colebrook formula\cite{Colebrook367},

\subsection{Blade Solidity Modification}
\label{sec:solidity}
%
%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_solidity
%

The power output of a turbine is proportional to the thrust that it
exerts onto the flow, and the larger the thrust, the larger the flow
resistance the turbine presents to the flow. The maximum power for any
wind turbine must lie in between two extremes, i.e. a very high and
a very low impedance both result in minimal power
extraction\cite{solidity_oxford}.  

For the case of a very high impedance, little fluid flows through the
turbine, instead it is diverted around the machine; for the case of a
very low impedance, the turbine hardly affects the flow.

So that the turbine presents an ``efficient'' impedance to the flow, the 
right balance between its solidity and tip speed ratio needs to be found.

If the solidity is high, the operating tip speed ratio has to be low in
order to avoid too high an impedance, which has numerous implications. 

Firstly, a low tip speed ratio implies increased torque so that a larger
and higher cost gearbox has to be used. Secondly, the lower the tip
speed ratio, the higher the maximum angle of attack, which can be
problematic with regard to blade stalling

However, it is hard to predict the precise effects of the various
phenomena, which is why it is difficult to comment on the overall
performance of a particular machine in a specific
scenario. \todo{rewrite all this}

Interesting enough, there are indications that wind turbines are
designed to operate at low tip speed ratios with high solidity ratios
would possess power coefficients close to Betz-like limits of
efficiency\cite{WE:WE118}. 

%When applied to a rotor with a finite number of blades, 

the actuator disk model treats the flow in the disk region as if it was
flowing through a rotor with identical solidity but an infinite number
of blades. 

The only thing that has had an impact was introducing a 'blockage' model
for the actuator disk model. This tries to represent the fact that as
the number of blades increased, the pressure across the actuator disk
should rise. We did this by adjusting the area of the actuator disk down
by the ratio of the free area in the disk versus the blade sizes. 
This admittedly crude model, todo\todo{write intro here}

The length of each blade blocking vertical flow in the actuator disk is, 
\begin{equation}
  Ch * \text{Cos}(\beta(r)) = Ch_x(r). 
\end{equation}
The total length in an annular region that is blocking is therefore,
\begin{equation}
  N * Ch_x(r) = l_B(r),
\end{equation}
Where N is the number of blades. 
Then, the ratio of an annular length that is impeded by blades is, 
\begin{eqnarray}
 B(r) =& \frac{2\pi r- l_B(r)}{2 \pi r}\\
 B(r) =& 1- \frac{l_B(r)}{2 \pi r}. 
\end{eqnarray}
Note that a ``floor'' function is needed to ensure the solidity ratio
does not go below zero. 

From a 1D control volume analysis for the region, with the continuity
equation, 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \rho V_z' A' =& \rho V_z A,\\
 V_z' =& V_z \frac{A}{A'}, \\
 V_z' =& \frac{V_z}{B(r)}.
\end{eqnarray}
Note that this implies that $V_z' \rightarrow \infty$ as $A' \rightarrow
0$. This is as expected, as the blockage becomes more severe, the flow
would need to move at greater speed to go through it. 

Our flow angle with respect to turbine velocity is therefore modified
from,

\begin{equation}
 \theta_f = \text{tan}^{-1}(\frac{U_{\text{up}}}{U_{\text{fwd}}})
\end{equation}
to,
\begin{equation}
 \theta_f = \text{tan}^{-1}(\frac{U_{\text{up}}}{B(r) U_{\text{fwd}}}). 
\end{equation}
As $B(r) \rightarrow 0$, $\theta_f \rightarrow \pi$, e.g. 90 degrees. In
this way the velocity vector will be completely aligned with drag. 

Furthermore, 
\begin{equation}
 F = \frac{1}{2}\frac{c \rho U_p^2}{A}(C_L \cdot n_{\text{lift}} + C_d \cdot n_{\text{drag}})
\end{equation}
Is modified so that, 
\begin{equation}
 \bar U_p^{2} = \left(\frac{U_p}{B(r)}\right)^2
\end{equation}

\section{Estimating the Upper Limit on Power Extraction}
\label{sec:peak_estimate}

All of the results in section \ref{subsec:field_predict} were generated
using 90 degree semicircle blade geometries, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:90_drag}. A natural question then is whether more power might
be extracted with a different rotor geometry. Time constraints required
fabrication of the turbine in short 
order, and a limited budget encouraged inexpensive (and therefore
simple) turbine blades. Finally, the design space was limited to 
readily available drag polar data due to the expense and difficulty of
fabricating non-standard turbine blades. Risk mitigation also played a
role, with an emphasis on traditional, and therefore well-vetted turbine
blade design. While several comparisons have been performed with
different choices of turbine blades (flat plate, 180 degree semicircles,
etc. ) this was not an exhaustive survey. This section details an
additional computational research program performed after the turbine
fabrication with the intent of estimating the upper limit of power
extraction with an idealized turbine. 

Practical utility-scale wind turbines achieve at peak 75\% to 80\% of
the Betz limit\cite{burton2001wind}. The Betz-limit states a theoretical
maximum of 59\% of the wind's power may be captured. Therefore,
practical wind turbines extract less than half of the available energy. 
Comparing the
kinetic energy flux of simulations without the turbine to the power
extracted by the turbine, we note that our simulations typically predict
power extraction ratios slightly less than fifty percent, indicating
that our efforts are not significantly better or worse than could be
expected. While this provides an estimate, the Betz-limit is likely not
accurate for this case. Any analysis of the power that can be extracted
is complicated by the presence of considerable vertical and azimuthal
flow in the vortex, and so the design considerations are different from
those for a classical wind turbine. 

The objective then, is to formulate a more generalized approach to the
turbine vane parameters to permit an optimization that is not
constrained to a particular turbine blade geometry. Rather, this
approach seeks to estimate the upper limit of power extracted. The
rationale behind this is to provide an upper bound on the power that can 
be extracted for a particular configuration, which can then be used as
input for feasiblity considerations of the SoV.  

It is desirable to perform these estimates within the context of the
actuator disk model (See Section~\ref{sec:actuator_disk}). While
actuator disk models are commonly
optimized\cite{790585,WE:WE487,en5093425,adkins1983design}, the lift and drag polars are 
not parameters that are varied in these schemes. Rather, a given blade
geometry is assumed and then the rotation rate, blade angle and chord
length (for instance) are optimized.   

Conversely, airfoil optimization is a rich field with sophisticated and
well-developed
techniques~\cite{drela1998pros,lewis2001aerodynamic,Chehouri2015361},
but these methods do not use an actuator disk model, and focus on the
shape optimization of the airfoil geometry (and through this, the lift
and drag polars). 

To address the possibility of further turbine blade
improvements, while simultaneously not representing the blade geometry
proper, this section details a formulation for a generic set of drag
polars. These generalized drag polars permit exploration of a broader
design space. The optimization of this model can be fully coupled to the
flow, and so does not violate any Betz-like considerations that might
similarly arise in an analysis of frozen flow fields.
The drag polars are selected to be generic functions and are optimized to
maximize the power extracted by the rotor. While the resulting drag
polars might not be physically  realizable, they represent a ``best
case'' upper bound indicating the peak power that might be extracted
with further rotor design iterations. This ``limiting case'' is useful
for evaluating the system feasibility from a technological standpoint,
by providing the peak power that could be extracted for a given vane
geometry. 

The power extracted by the turbine is, 
\begin{equation}
 P = \Omega Q
\end{equation}
where the torque, Q, is, 
\begin{equation}
 Q = A_R \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} F''_{\tau}\, r\, dr d\theta.
\end{equation}
Here, $A_R$ is the relative area coefficient which is, 
\begin{equation}
A_R = \frac{c B (r_{\text{max}}-r_{\text{min}})}{\pi(r_{\text{max}}^2-r_{\text{min}}^2)}
\end{equation}
where B is the number of blades, $r_{\text{max}}$ and $r_{\text{min}}$
are the turbine radii, and $F''_{\tau}$ is the force per unit
area on the turbine, which is, 
\begin{equation}
 F''_{\tau} = \frac{F_{\tau}}{cl}= \frac{1}{2}\rho U_R^2 \, C_{\tau}.
\end{equation}
with $U_R$ the magnitude of relative velocity and $c$ is the blade chord
length, which is assumed to be constant (not a function of the radius,
for instance). Finally, $C_{\tau}$ is the tangential force coefficient,
which depends on the local lift and drap coefficients, and the
flow angle, $\phi$, 
\begin{equation}
 C_{\tau} = C_L \,\text{sin}(\phi) + C_D \,\text{cos}(\phi)
\end{equation}
Combining the equations above results in an expression for the power
that explicitly depends on the lift and drag coefficients, 
\begin{equation*}
 P = \frac{\Omega \rho c B (r_{\text{max}}-r_{\text{min}})}{2 \pi(r_{\text{max}}^2-r_{\text{min}}^2)}
\int_0^{2\pi}
\int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} U_R(r,\theta,\Omega)^2 \left(C_L
						     \,\text{sin}(\phi)
						     + C_D
						     \,\text{cos}(\phi)
						    \right) r\,dr d\theta. 
\end{equation*}
We lump the constant terms together, $E_{\tau} = \frac{\Omega \rho c B (r_{\text{max}}-r_{\text{min}})}{2 \pi(r_{\text{max}}^2-r_{\text{min}}^2)}$ and separate this equation, 
\begin{align}
 P_L = E_\tau
 \int_0^{2\pi}
  \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} U_R(r,\theta,\Omega)^2 \, C_L(\phi,r)
 \,\text{sin}(\phi)\, r\,dr d\theta,  \label{lift} \\
 P_D = E_\tau
 \int_0^{2\pi}
  \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} U_R(r,\theta,\Omega)^2 \, C_D(\phi,r) \,\text{cos}(\phi)\, r\,dr d\theta. \label{drag}
\end{align}
Note that we have assumed $C_D = C_D(\phi,r)$ and $C_L = C_L(\phi,r)$,
namely, that the coefficients vary with the flow direction and may vary
radially, due to twisting the blade angle. Furthermore, the flow
direction, $\phi$, varies with the location and the blade speed,
in that $\phi=\phi(r,\theta,\Omega)$. The relative velocity is the
quantity, $U_R = U - U_\tau$, e.g. the difference in velocity between
the turbine and the flow. The turbine has no axial velocity ($w_\tau =
0$) and a constant rotation speed, and so the two components of velocity
in the plane of rotation can be expressed as,
\begin{align}
 u_\tau = \Omega \,r\, \text{sin}(\theta)\\
 v_\tau = \Omega \,r\, \text{cos}(\theta)
\end{align}

Our objective is now to discover what these unknown functions of lift
and drag are. To do this, we specify an optimization problem such that, 
\begin{equation*} 
 \text{Max } P(C_L,C_D) \quad \text{ subject to: }
  \begin{cases}
   |C_L| < C_L^{\text{Max}}, \\
   0 < C_D < C_D^{\text{Max}}. \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

In words, the drag must be specified to be greater than zero, but
the lift can be negative. This is a problem in the calculus of
variations, where the objective is to maximize a
functional\ref{thornton2004classical,bradbury1968theoretical,2015JFM...784..565S}
subject to imposed constraints.

betz\todo{finish me}
The integral shown in Equation \ref{lift} above can be bounded by 
Schwarz's Inequality,  
\begin{align*}
  \left[
    \int_0^{2\pi}
    \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} C_L(\phi,r)\, U_R(r,\theta,\Omega)^2
 \,\text{sin}(\phi)\, r\,dr d\theta \right]^2 \le \\
  \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} C_L^2(\phi,r) dr d\theta\,
  \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} U_R(r,\theta,\Omega)^4 
 \,\text{sin}^2(\phi)\, r^2\,dr d\theta.
\end{align*}

In this way the quantity,
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^{2\pi}
 \int_{r_{\text{min}}}^{r_{\text{max}}} C_L^2(\phi,r) dr d\theta, 
\end{equation}
is clearly maximized when $C_L(\phi,r) = C_L^{\text{max}}$. 
The result for Equation \ref{drag} is identical. Now, for these
conditions, we are interested in largest attainable values. For the drag
coefficient, $C_D^{\text{Max}}$ is two. % refmunson 
This corresponds to a flat plate perpendicular to the flow.
The lift coefficient peak is about 1.75. This design is not necessarily
physically realizable, but represents an absolute maximum. 

Therefore, our lift/drag functions may be expressed as,
\begin{align*} 
 C_D(\phi) = \bar C_D \, \psi(\phi) 
  \begin{cases}
   \psi(\phi) = 1 \text{ if sin}(\phi) > 0,   \\
   0 \text{ else} \\
  \end{cases} \\
 C_L(\phi) = \bar C_L \, \Psi(\phi) 
  \begin{cases}
   \Psi(\phi) = 1 \text{ if cos}(\phi) > 0,   \\
   -1 \text{ else}. \\
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
Where $\bar C_L = 1.7$ and $\bar C_D = 2.0$.

%Thus, the drag polars
%have the form, 
%\begin{align*} 
% &C_L(\phi) = 
%  \begin{cases}
%    1.75& \quad 0^{\circ} \le \phi \le 180^{\circ}, \\
%   -1.75& \quad 180^{\circ} \le \phi \le 360^{\circ}.  \\
%  \end{cases}\\
% &C_D(\phi) = 
%  \begin{cases}
%    2.0& \quad -90^{\circ} \le \phi \le 90^{\circ}, \\
%      0& \quad 90^{\circ} \le \phi \le 270^{\circ}.  \\
%  \end{cases}\\
%\end{align*}
The plot of these drag polars are shown in Figure \ref{drags}.

Under this approach, the steady state power extracted by the
turbine nearly doubled from the previous best attained with the 90
degree semicircles, to 2.1 kW.\todo{add info of energy extracted}

mention that flow would die if you didnt calibrate it

 The results of this model demonstrate a limit on how much of the energy
 can be extracted before disrupting the flow so greatly
 that the vortex cannot be maintained.
