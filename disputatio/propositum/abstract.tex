Much of the solar energy incident on the Earth's surface is absorbed
into the ground, which in turn heats the air layer above the surface.
This buoyant air layer contains considerable gravitational potential
energy. The energy can drive the formation of columnar vortices
 (``Dust-Devils'') which  
arise naturally in the atmosphere. A new energy harvesting approach
 makes use of this phenomenon by creating and anchoring the vortices
 artificially and extracting energy from them. In this research
 proposal, we explore the  characteristics of these vorticies through
 numerical  simulation. Computational models of the turning vane system
 which generates the vortex and the turbine used to extract energy
 have been developed. 
 The formulation of these models and their validation
 against available experimental measurements will be discussed, as will
 the details of the columnar vortex structure and its interaction with
 the turbine. In addition, the computational models are being used to
 optimize the turning vane configuration and the turbine characteristics
 to maximize the power extraction, in order to assess the technological
 feasibility of the project. 
 %This optimization and to characterize the effects of
 %environmental conditions such as cross winds and
 %topography. 
 Preliminary results from these studies will also 
 be presented.
