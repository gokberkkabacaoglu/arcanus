\section{Model}

\begin{itemize}
\item unstable stratified boundary layers (raleigh number estimate)
\item justify incompressible N-S
\item justification of far-field eddy-viscosity model (M-O)
\item modeling eddy-viscosity in device 
\item vane and turbine representation
\item cone representation
\end{itemize}

%remember that \st{} is strikethrough

This section uses our blurb from the viscosity document
includes raleigh 
we know the physical regime

then it discusses equations
then it discusses the viscosity model
