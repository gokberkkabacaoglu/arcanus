The aim of the proposed work is to simulate the formation of synthetic
dust devils in the field. This requires a model of the ambient
conditions for a representative case, such as Arizona, where
experimental data is available from test that have been
performed. Furthermore, for this to be more generally useful in the
prediction of flows in a variety of conditions, we need a model generally
applicable to any flow near the surface of the earth.  

This section details an analysis of surface fluid mechanics, and
develops a mathematical model for turbulence in a thermally stratified
medium. We seek to emulate the operation of the apparatus during the day, 
when dust devils are observed to form readily. 
At these times, the atmospheric surface layer has the following character. 
Incident radiation from the sun does not significantly interact with the
air, which is nearly transparent. Instead, this radiation is absorbed by
the ground, which causes it's temperature to rise. This results in a thermal
gradient between the hot ground and the cooler air. The warm ground
conducts heat to the air, causing expansion and lowering the density
of the air. This reduced density air near the surface is driven upwards
by the force of buoyancy.  

For sufficiently large temperature gradients, these motions are
unstable, and as the warm air is driven upwards the flow will transition
to turbulence. For the typical use case we consider, namely Arizona in
summer, the temperature difference can be in excess of 30 Kelvin. 
Rayleigh numbers associated with temperature gradients of this magnitude
this are between $10^{9} - 10^{11}$, and therefore meet the criterion
for transition to a turbulent regime. The flow is that of an unstably
stratified fluid.  

This section begins by describing the governing equations of the system
of interest. It then proceeds to the development of a viscosity model
used to resolve the large scale features of the solution. Next, models
used to represent the vanes and turbine, as well as the separation of
fluid off of these modeled surfaces, are introduced.  Finally, the
models for the computational domain extent and the boundary conditions
are discussed. 

Note that a complete mathematical specification of all the model
parameters introduced in this section are provided in a table in
appendix \ref{app:model_param}.

\subsection{Equations of Fluid Motion}
%
% do I need to justify this more? These are pretty critical, after all
%

The equations describing fluid flow with natural convection are,
\begin{eqnarray}
 \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \cdot \nabla u =&
  -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla P + \nu \nabla^2 u - g \frac{T'}{T_0}\\
  \label{eqn:ns_mom}
 \nabla \cdot u =& 0 \\
  \label{eqn:ns_cont}
 \rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + u \cdot \nabla T =& \nabla \cdot ( k \nabla T).
  \label{eqn:ns_en}
\end{eqnarray} 

Where we have made the assumptions that the temperature variation is small in
comparison to the mean temperature of the region. These are the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with Boussinesq representation of
buoyancy coupled with the heat equation.  
%
% in full document be sure to mention that neglecting coriolis is legit
% below 50ms
%
%
As discussed above, we anticipate our flow to be
turbulent. Turbulence significantly alters the character of the flow,
and necessitates either resolving the resulting small scales or
providing a model that emulates their impact. In this case, we use a
Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) formulation, where we 
permit the viscosity and thermal conductivities to vary in space, and
decompose the flow into constant laminar and varying turbulent and vane
components,  

% \begin{eqnarray*}
%  \nu =& \nu_{l} + \nu_{T}(z) + \nu_{V}(r,z) \\
%  K =& K_{l} + K_{T}(z) + K_{V}(r,z)
% \end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
 \nu =& \nu_{l} + \nu_{T}(z) + \nu_{V}(r,z) \\
 K =& K_{l} + K_{T}(z) + K_{V}(r,z).
\end{eqnarray*}

This is an effective eddy viscosity model, and the subsequent two
sections will elaborate on the spatial dependence and character of
$\nu_T$, $K_T$, $\nu_C$ and $K_C$. $\nu_l$ and $K_l$ are the laminar,
base diffusivities and do not vary in space. 

\subsection{Viscosity Model}

We use the celebrated similarity model of Monin and
Obukhov\cite{monin2007statistical,monin1954basic} as a guide to the
present development, which we outline below. Their formulation is an
extension of the mixing-length model of Prandtl, where the concepts of
gradient diffusion and mixing length were generalized to thermally
stratified flow.   

%
% justify prandtl assumption here
%

Monin and Obukhov argued that under temporally steady, horizontally
homogeneous conditions, the dynamics of any mean turbulent quantity
($\bar f$) in a thermally stratified medium which depends only on,  

\begin{equation}
\bar f = f(z,\frac{g}{T_0},\rho_0,\nu_l,K_l,u^*,q).
\end{equation}
Aside from near the surface, the laminar diffusivities $\nu_l$ and $K_l$ will be
 small compared to their turbulent counter-parts, $\nu_T$ and $K_T$, and
 are therefore negligible. 
The remaining five parameters are: the distance from the ground, z; the
buoyancy coefficient, $\frac{g}{T_0}$; the density of the fluid,
$\rho_0$; a velocity scale, $u^*$; and the heat flux from the ground,
$q$. 
% Likewise, if we define $z-z_0$ as an ``effective roughness
% height'' or displacement distance, we can reasonably neglect $z_0$ from these
% considerations. While the roughness height can be large (for instance in
% a cornfield, where the roughness height could reasonably be several
% meters), for the present study the expectation is that this roughness
% height will be on the order of centimeters\cite{oke1987boundary}, and
% therefore negligible.  
%
% add refence to dynamical and physical meteorology 
% 
These quantities depend on four dimensions: length, time, temperature
and mass. Dimensional analysis implies that this mean turbulent quantity
($\bar f$) should then only be a function of a single dimensionless
group.\cite{munson2012fundamentals}. This is chosen to be,
\begin{equation}
 \xi = \frac{z}{L_{M-O}}.
\end{equation}
$L_{M-O}$ is the famous, ``Monin-Obukhov'' length,
\begin{equation}
 L_{M-O} = -\frac{{u^*}^3}{\kappa \frac{g}{T_0} \frac{q}{c_p \rho_0}}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ is the (dimensionless) Von-Karman constant. 
The physical meaning of $L_{M-O}$, the Monin-Obukhov length, bears some discussion. 
The numerator is proportional to the kinetic energy generated by the ambient 
shear of the fluid. The denominator is the buoyant production of kinetic energy. 
As a result, this length scale can be interpreted as the physical location where the
production of buoyant kinetic energy is approximately equal to the energy generated 
by wind shear. When the magnitude of $L_{M-O}$ is large, the flow is dominated
by shear effects, and the impact of buoyancy is small. Conversely, a small 
magnitude of $L_{M-O}$ implies that buoyant effects largely dominate the kinetic energy production.

The mean quantity $\bar f$ has a
functional representation to the effect,

Then appropriately normalized mean turbulent quantities should be
functions of the only non-dimensional group 
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\bar f}{f_{MO}} = \phi(\xi)
\end{equation}
with $f_{MO}$ a normalizing constant with units of $\bar f$, and $\phi$ is a
function only of $\xi$. We are interested in the case where $\xi<0$, which
corresponds to heat flux from the ground into the air.
For instance, the mean velocity field would have
scaling, $\frac{u^*}{\kappa}$ and the temperature fields would be scaled
as $T^* = \frac{1}{\kappa u^*} \frac{q}{c_p \rho_0}$. In this way, the
mean velocity and temperature fields would have the form, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar u(z) = \frac{u^*}{\kappa} \phi_u(\frac{z}{L_{M-O}}) \\
\bar T(z) = T^* \phi_T(\frac{z}{L_{M-O}}).
\end{eqnarray}
As a result, the vertical gradients of the velocity and temperature are
necessarily, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial \bar u(z)}{\partial z} = \frac{u^*}{\kappa L_{M-O}}
 \varphi_u(\frac{z}{L_{M-O}}) \label{eq:uz} \\ 
\frac{\partial \bar T(z)}{\partial z} = \frac{T^*}{L_{M-O}}
 \varphi_T(\frac{z}{L_{M-O}}) \label{eq:tz}.
\end{eqnarray}
Notice that $\phi$ and $\varphi$ are different universal functions. Eddy
viscosity is defined as, $u'v' = \nu_T \frac{\partial
u}{\partial z}$\cite{durbin2001statistical}, in which case, using
equation \ref{eq:uz}, it must scale as,  
\begin{equation}
 \nu_T = \frac{{u^*}^2}{\frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial z}} = \frac{u^*
  \kappa L_{M-O}}{\varphi_u(\xi)}.
\end{equation}
While eddy thermal diffusivity (defined as, $q = c_p \rho_0 K_T \frac{\partial T}{\partial
z}$) is, 
\begin{equation}
 K_T = \frac{q/c_p \rho_0}{\frac{\partial \bar T}{\partial z}} = \frac{u^*
  \kappa L_{M-O}}{\varphi_T(\xi)}.
\label{eqn:eddy_kt}
\end{equation}
Note that while we have differentiated between $\varphi_u$ and
$\varphi_T$, for turbulent Prandtl numbers near unity (e.g. $Pr_T
\approx 1$) the functions will be identical. The asymptotic behavior of
the $\varphi_T$ and $\varphi_u$ at 
large and small values of $\xi$ provides guidance on more general character of the
functions. We are interested in the case where $L_{M-O}<0$, which corresponds to 
heat flux from the ground into the air. 
%


The case where $\xi \to -\infty $ implies $\frac{z}{L_{M-O}} \to
-\infty $ and $z>>L_{M-O}$. This is most readily interpreted as the instance
where $u^* \to 0$, e.g. the buoyancy-dominated case with no wind
(free-convection). For this case, the function $\varphi_T$ must hold no
dependence on $u^*$, and will approach a constant value. Scaling
analysis implies that the overall function will not depend on $u^*$ only
when the function $\varphi$ scales to the $-\frac{4}{3}$ power. The
resulting function appears as

\begin{equation}
 K_T = \frac{1}{C_T} \left( \frac{q}{c_p \rho_0} \frac{g}{T_0}
		     \right)^\frac{1}{3} z^{\frac{4}{3}}  \text{ 
for } z \gg L_{M-O}. 
\end{equation}

So long as the Prandtl number remains constant in space, then
% todo: provide discussion as to why this is not an unreasonable expectation
identical arguments as to the asymptotic behaviour at large $\xi$ provide
the analogous result for the eddy viscosity's variation with respect to
distance from the ground,  
\begin{equation}
 \nu_T = \frac{1}{C_{\nu_T}} \left( \frac{q}{c_p \rho_0} \frac{g}{T_0}
			     \right)^\frac{1}{3} z^{\frac{4}{3}}  \text{ 
for } z \gg L_{M-O}. 
\end{equation}

These functions have been found to be broadly applicable and
accurate\cite{Foken2006}, and are easily instantiated in software.

\subsection{Eddy Viscosity in Device}

%However, this is also a more
%difficult regime to model.\todo{poor justification} 
The validation process identified a refinement to the virtual vane
formulation that results in a better representation of the vane
effects in a broader range of flows. 

The thermal and momentum diffusivities are even larger in the
device where the flow across the vanes produces shear and generates
turbulence. The model now include an enhanced turbulent diffusivity in
the vortical plume region to account for the effects of vortex shedding
from the trailing edge of the vanes, which is not inherent in the
virtual vane representation.   

% To successfully accomplish this, source terms
% for production of diffusivity were formulated to properly
% account for the generation of turbulence in the region of the
% vanes. This diffusivity would then convect and diffuse through space. 
% To avoid modeling a temporal and three-dimensionally spatially
% varying field of diffusivities, we have instead calibrated the field
% based on data provided by our partners at Georgia Tech. 

%This calibration
%is detailed in Section \ref{sec:validation}. 
The eddy-viscosity in the region of the vanes and interior is set based
on scaling relations for a turbulent self-similar circular jet, as in 
Pope\cite{pope2000turbulent}
 
\begin{equation}
  \nu_C = U_0 y_{1/2} \bar \nu_C.
  %\nu_C(r) = U_0(r) y_{1/2}(r) \bar \nu_C
\end{equation}

In this equation, $U_0$ is the peak velocity, and $y_{1/2}$ the jet
half-width (taken to be the dust devil half-width).  
% In words, we are scaling the
% calibrated viscosity by the velocity and length scale of the
% apparatus. $\bar \nu_C $ is input, measured from the experimental
% laboratory.  The diffusivity here is essentially a top hat filter, which
% radial values interior to the vanes the nominal calibrated value, and
% those outside the vanes zero, e.g. $\nu_C(r>r_{\text{vane}})=0$. 
The dimensionless constant $\bar \nu_C $ is calibrated based on
experimental data, and is set to zero outside the device. 
The thermal diffusivity inside the device, $K_C$, is then fixed with the 
assumption that the Prandtl number is unity.  

%The thermal and momentum diffusivities are expected to be even larger in the
%device where the flow across the vanes produces shear and generates
%turbulence. Our model for the diffusivities inside the vanes should
%therefore be higher than the ambient regions outside the vanes. 



\subsection{Vane and Turbine Representation}
\label{subsec:vane}
To rapidly prototype general system configurations, the
computations must be able to explore a large space of possible
geometries and settings. This presents a significant meshing and 
computational challenge if the detailed flow around the vanes is to be
computed. In the region near the vanes, where a no-slip boundary
condition is imposed, the flow will necessarily form a thin momentum
boundary layer. Resolving this boundary layer requires high resolutions
immediately adjacent to the walls. Changing the vane location requires
that a new mesh be generated.
This is a significant
challenge, as the development of a new mesh often requires significant
human effort and time. Furthermore, the process is error-prone, 
and would require that each simulation using a new mesh undergo 
detailed solution verification. 


% Your text on the virtual vanes does not provide enough information to
% know exactly what we did. It is needlessly vague, and does not
% adequately connect to the real vane geometry. I propose the following
% more direct and more precise text. Further, the penalty nomenclature
% is inappropriate.

Instead, we have developed a modeling formulation that does not require
explicitly meshing the turning vanes, or any surface. These so-called
"virtual vanes" are implemented as a body force that 
is applied in the annular region that contains the vanes. Vane
geometry is specified by the angle $\phi$ a vane makes with a radial
line as a function of the radial coordinate $r$. A unit normal to vane
surfaces ${\bf n}$ is thus defined as
%
\begin{equation}
 {\bf n}({\bf x}) = \sin \left(\phi(r) \right) \hat{{\bf r}}+ \cos \left(\phi(r) \right) \hat{{\bf \theta}}
\end{equation}
%
where $\hat{{\bf r}}$ and $\hat{{\bf \theta}}$ are unit
vectors in the radial and azimuthal directions respectively.
With this vane-normal vector field specified, a body force ${\bf f_v}$
is defined
that will drive the velocity in the ${\bf n}$ direction toward zero,
effectively turning the flow to be parallel to the vanes. The body
force is defined:
\begin{equation}
 {\bf f}_v= -\frac{1}{\ell_v}|{\bf u}|({\bf u}\cdot{\bf n}){\bf n}
 \label{eqn:body_force}
\end{equation}
with ${\bf u}$ the velocity and $\ell_v$ is a specified length
scale. The length scale $\ell_v$ represents the distance over which the
flow evolves under the influence of the body force before the
velocity in the normal direction is reduced by a factor of $1/{\bf
e}$. In other words, this is the distance over which the
normal component of the velocity decays exponentially.
It is a modeling constant and is specified to be
the same order as the separation distance between neighboring vanes in
the physical vane configuration, since entry lengths in internal flows
scale with the size of the channel.

This virtual vane formulation is similar to the ``actuator disk'' model
commonly used to represent the rotor of a wind turbine \cite{betz}.


\subsection{Solid Surface Representation}
\label{subsec:solid_surface}

This subsection details the model used for rigid, impermiable surfaces
such as the wind break (``cone'') on the top of the facility. As with
the turning vanes, this is accomplished without explicitly meshing the
surface nor imposing  a boundary condition at the surface. This permits
rapid exploration of configurations  with different solid surfaces to
control and manipulate the fluid flow. These solid surfaces are also
represented by a body force region applied where the wall is set to be
located in.  A vector normal to the surface is defined in this region so
that a body force will push  the velocity to zero, resulting in the flow
moving only parallel to the virtual surface. For instance, the outward
facing unit normal for a cylindrical surface is represented as 
\begin{equation}
 {\bf n}({\bf x}) = \hat{{\bf r}}+ \sin \left(\theta\right) \hat{{\bf \theta}}.
\end{equation}
In this equation, $\theta$ is the angle between the spatial location and
radial line. The body force is defined as in equation
\ref{eqn:body_force}; however, the length scale $\ell_v$ is specified to
be identical to the width  of the surface being represented. This is
typically two or three grid points. While the actual surface we are
emulating is thin, the numerical method has difficulty converging for
surfaces smaller than the grid size.  

Forcing designed to mimic a surface
is not unique to this project, and is closely related to (among others)
the ``immersed boundary methods'' used by various other
researchers\cite{doi:10.1146/annurev.fluid.37.061903.175743}. 
This approach is unique in its use of Babuska's penalty treatment of
constraints\cite{1973fempen,ZAMM:ZAMM19880680925} to enforce the
behavior at the boundary. This method was selected because it is easily
imposed in the FEM context, and the method has been explored in detail
in the literature. Typically, the enforcement occurs along a domain
boundary, but in this work it is used in the interior. 

This approach includes a penalty term for violating a selected
constraint in a variation formulation. As an example, consider Laplace's 
equation on a domain $\Omega$ with boundary $\partial\Omega$, 
\begin{equation}
 \nabla^2 u = 0. 
\end{equation}
Dirichlet boundary conditions are introduced into the weak form
\begin{equation}
 u|_{\partial \Omega} = g
\end{equation}
which becomes 
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega}  - \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \, dx - \frac{1}{\epsilon}
 \int_{\partial \Omega} (u-g) \cdot v \, ds = 0 \quad \forall v \in H^1(\Omega)
\end{equation}
where $v$ is an appropriate test function, $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ is the
penalty parameter and $H^1(\Omega)$ is the Sobolev space of functions on
$\Omega$. This is the weak form for Laplace's equation with a Robin boundary condition 
\begin{align}
 u = g - \epsilon \, \partial_n u. 
\end{align}
For sufficiently small $\epsilon$, the original Dirichlet boundary
conditions will be satisfied approximately. Clearly, $\epsilon$ has
units of length, and can be interpreted as a ``slip length''. 

%
% In the
% Navier-Stokes solver, this penalty formulation is used to approximately
% impose the no-flow through for impermiable surfaces, such as the
% cone.
%
%
% you will need to motivate and then write down your actual formulation
% including the finite width of the forcing layer
%
% these should be written down mathematically
%

By analogy with the method above, we add a penalty term to the weak
form of the Navier-Stokes momentum equation described in the subsequent
section %\ref{eq:ns_weak} 
that has the form, 
\begin{equation}
P_\epsilon = \int_\Omega ({\bf f_v} \cdot v) \, dx
\end{equation}
where ${\bf f_v}$ is as described in equation \ref{eqn:body_force}. 
As the system is formulated as a variation problem that seeks to
minimize the test function $v$, any velocity that is not aligned with
the vane normal will incur a penalty versus one that does. Note that unlike
some penalty methods, this does not automatically satisfy
continuity. Rather, the velocity field remains divergence free through a
separately enforced constraint.  

\subsection{Separation Model}

In the presence of wind, it was found that there was a significant flow
out through the vanes in the back of the device. This was obviously
inconsistent with the findings of our colleagues in the field, who
observed no outflows out of the back of device. Moreover, this resulted
in large inconsistencies between our predictions and the field results,
almost certainly because of the kinetic and thermal energy that our vane
representation was permitting to leave out the back of the device.  

This exposed a weakness of the turning vane representation outlined
previously. When the flow entered the virtual vane forcing region it was
always turned to align with the vane angle, even when the forcing was in
the opposite direction of the present velocity.
This is in contrast to our physical intuition, where we
expect the flow to continue along an averaged streamline
off the trailing edges of the vanes, instead of turning around. 
The averaged streamline (e.g. the statistically average behavior, not
an instant flow field) will continue past the trailing edge of the vane
due to the separation of the boundary layer off the edge surface. An
image depicting these two cases in shown in figure \ref{fig:sep_model}.  

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width = 6 cm]{figs/sep_model}
    \caption{Schematic depicting the separation model that extends past
   the trailing edge of the vanes. In the top case, the flow entering
   the virtual vane region is forced to align with the vane angle despite
   this resulting in a reversal of the flow direction. This is a
   consequence of the forcing function acting on the fluid to ensure the
   velocity vector aligns with the vane. 
   The second case depicts the separation
   model, where the flow under certain conditions is not forced and
   continues to move tangent to the vanes due to 
   the separation of the boundary layer off the trailing edge.} 
    \label{fig:sep_model}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Let $\bf n^v$ be the normal vector to the vanes in a horizontal plane,
and $\bf n^r$ the normal vector pointing out of the vane
region\footnote{\normalsize The superscripts ``v'' and ``r'' stand for
vane and radial, respectively.}.  
Then, $\bf t^v$ is the tangential vector to the vanes pointing out of
the vane region and is defined as,
\begin{equation}
 \bf t^v = \left( {\bf n^v_y},{\bf -n_x^v} \right) \text{sign}\left[
	    \left( {\bf n^v_y},{\bf -n_x^v} \right) \cdot {\bf n^r} \right].
\end{equation}

  radius of vanes, and $\delta$ is the width of the separation region.}

%

The forcing is modified when the velocity vector of the local flow, $\bf
u$ is pointing in to the forcing region: ${\bf u} \cdot {\bf n^r} < 0$, and
when the velocity vector is in the same direction as the tangent line to
the vanes: ${\bf u} \cdot {\bf t^v} > 0 $. In these instances, the
forcing acts as if there was a rigid surface past the vane edge, and
gives the appearance of a special ``no-penetration'' condition for the
velocity for these cases. The pseudo-code for this procedure is shown in
algorithm~\ref{alg:sep}.

The addition of this simple separation model significantly reduced the
flow that penetrated the back of the vanes, and produces results
consistent with the observations provided by our experimental
colleagues.  

\subsection{Effect of Surface Roughness}

%% model -- rewrite
%%
%%
%% this does not say enough about the surface roughness
%% motivate that and explain how it is used, than show your estimate 
%% to argue it is small
%%

Surface roughness effects have been shown to play a role in the
formation of dust-devils and related atmospheric
phenomena\cite{oke1987boundary}. For the flat and sandy regions we are
simulating, the impact is expected to be a small thermal ``kick-up''
versus an entirely smooth surface. This is modeled as a volumetric 
forcing over a narrow height over the surface, 
\begin{equation}
 F^{'''}_{z_0} = \frac{1}{2}\rho V_z^2/z_{0}, 
\end{equation}
and $z_{0}$ is the roughness height. We ensure that the energy
introduced into flow is small fraction of total flow energy by comparing
this with the energy flux through the top of the vanes. The total energy
added is measured as,  
\begin{equation}
 E_{\text{injected}} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^R \int_0^{z_0} F^{'''}_{z_0} dz dr d\theta. 
\end{equation}
R is the outer diameter of the vanes. 
The value of $E_{\text{injected}}$ is typically a few percent of the
total energy kinetic energy flux measured through the top of the
vanes.

%This general forcing provides additional capabilities including the
%ability to investigate engineering greater surface roughness or
%structures that could provide greater ``kick-up'' of the thin thermal
%layer near the surface into the flowing regime. It can also support more
%general turning configurations than the virtual vanes outlined above. 

\subsection{Simulation Geometry and Boundary Conditions}
\label{sec:bc}

\textbf{Computational Domain} 

All simulations are performed in a cuboid domain, with six
faces. The mesh has a uniform spacing in the lateral directions, 
except for a double refinement in the region of the vanes. 
The mesh is  non-uniform in height to resolve the boundary layer, 
\begin{equation}

For the ``thermal-only'' case study (no mean wind), 
periodic boundary conditions are used on the four sides, a modified
neumann condition\cite{gunzburger1989finite} on the top boundary, and
dirichlet boundary conditions on the bottom (the ground).\todo{write
down the math} These are shown schematically in Figure
\ref{fig:thermalbc}. On the ground, a ``no-slip'' velocity boundary
condition is imposed on the velocity field, and a dirichlet condition
uniformly fixes the temperature of the surface. 

\textbf{Wall Boundary Conditions} 

\textbf{Inflow Boundary Conditions} 



\textbf{Mixed inflow/outflow Boundary Conditions} 

The modified neumann condition is necessary due to the presence of both\todo{write the math}
inflow and outflow across the face. In the region approximately above
the vanes, the concentrated hot plume is lifted by buoyancy
upward and out of the simulation domain. However, the radial inflow
towards the apparatus is drawn in by large scale convection cells larger
than the system diameter. Thus, our boundary conditions must permit
inflow along the areas above and external to the vanes. To avoid an
ill-posed problem, the ``v'' and ``u'' components of inflow velocity are
set to zero.

Finally, a ``sponge layer'' is often used near these boundaries.
This layer artificially increases the momentum diffusivity by
up to ten times the nominal value. 
This was designed in response to instabilities in the modified 
neumann boundary condition that occurred when small, high velocity fluid
parsels would exit the boundary. This would create small high velocity inflows, and
the feedback loop would result in instabilities and numerical blow-up. Mindful of the fact 
that the character of solution not important in this region, and that
our physical interest remains focused on the region inside and
in immediate proximity to the vanes, we introduced a higher diffusivity
``sponge'' region that would diffuse the high velocity exiting jets
sufficiently to prevent numerically un-physical behavior. No results are
quoted from this ``sacrificial'' region, as it is not considered physically
meaningful. These regions are referred to by many names in the
literature\cite{doi:10.1146/annurev.fluid.36.050802.121930}, such as
absorbing layers, fringe regions, buffer zones, sponges, etc.

The wind cases are diagrammed in figures \ref{fig:windstream} and\todo{need
3d image} \ref{fig:windspan}. The wind case has a proscribed inlet boundary layer
for both the temperature profile as well as the velocity. The velocity
boundary layer is set to the common 7th power function for a
turbulent boundary layer,  
\begin{equation*}
  u_{in}(z) = U \text{ min }\left(\left(\frac{z}{\delta}\right)^7,1\right)
\end{equation*}
where $\delta$, the boundary layer thickness, is set based on data
measured by our experimental partners in the field. 
The thermal boundary layer is assumed to have a similar boundary layer,
but, as observed in real atmospheric flows, there remains a vertical
temperature gradient outside the thin boundary layer. Based on
literature a $2/3$ Kelvin per meter gradient has been
selected\cite{Blocken2007238}. The sides, outflow and top are all set to
modified neumann boundary conditions, as described above. The outflow
region in the back also needs the modified neumann as it does
occasionally exhibit mild inflow on account of the unsteady wake.
