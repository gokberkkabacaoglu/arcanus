\begin{itemize}
\item \st{main event!}
\item ``proposed'' new runs and physical investigation
\item rough time line
\item discuss the program of runs designed to explore a wide configuration space
\item calibrated turbine -- and what else?
\item \st{make clear the objective is to assess feasibility, not to prove it can work}
\item make table of 'state of the art' or novel work expected to have been performed
\item what (fundamental) questions do you want to ask?
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Can we link phenomena to naturally occuring?
      \item By what geometries is the flow intensified, and why
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The objective of this research project is to provide a definitive
assessment of the  
technological feasibility of the entire synthetic columnar vortex
concept as a means of generating usable energy. In the 
previous sections we have briefed the reader on the present state of the
simulation capability. In doing so, we have discussed the physics that
influence dust devils formation, as well as our particular mathematical
models for the ambient conditions as well as the SoV vanes, cone and
turbine. We summarized the numerical discretizations used, the software
stack and the calibration, verification and validation of these
components. The purpose of these sections was to convince the reader of
two major points. The first point is that an accurate, verified and
validated simulation capability has been developed that can quickly
investigate a wide variety of system and scenario settings at a modest
computational cost. The second point is that we have developed
heuristics that permit optimization of any baseline SoV configuration to
a local maximum of energy production, as measured by kinetic energy flux
through the top of the SoV vanes.  

These two points justify the proposed course of work, which is to
broadly sweep through a large space of possible system configurations
and geometries, and in doing so, discover the globally optimal structure
of the SoV apparatus. Coupled with the scaling analysis presented in
section \ref{sec:physics}, we will then be able to predict the
conditions (if any) under which the SoV apparatus will be
technologically competitive with different methods of energy
generation. In other words, the proposed research is designed to assess
feasibility, and it is not expected that actual experimental validation
will accompany the computational results. Furthermore, it must also be
emphasized that feasibility here is focused on technological capability,
and will not include an economic assessment. In other words, it is
possible that the SoV will produce energy, but the design required to do
is prohibitively expensive, and therefore not economically competitive
with existing technologies.

We now outline a program of runs designed to explore a wide
configuration space. We begin by noting that we have three 
optimization domains, for the cone, turbine and vanes. Table
\ref{tab:vane} lists the proposed optimization parameters for the
vanes.

code ready
expertise ready
plan outlined
ls5 delay?
more compute time
need more runs? this is a serious concern
do we need a comprehensive metric for success?
