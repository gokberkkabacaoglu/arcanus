\label{sec:result}

While ambient winds in the field do impact system performance, our present work focuses on 
an idealized scenario with natural convection driven only by thermal instabilities. Investigating 
this baseline, thermal-only flow is intended to optimize the SoV apparatus to form a strong 
thermal plume even in the absence of wind. After a system is engineered to form a strong 
thermal plume, we will then work to ensure that the existing thermal vortex will be strengthened 
by the addition of winds.    

Results from previous simulations of the straight, multiple tiered vane systems implied that 
the inlet angles of the vanes were too severe versus the ambient flow being drawn into the 
apparatus. As a result, the vanes were blocking the incoming flow, and were resulting in an 
adverse pressure gradient existing near the outside edge of the vanes. This served to force fluid 
around and over the system, instead of inside the turning vanes. This reduces the velocity of flow 
inside the system, resulting in a weaker thermal vortex. 
In order to reduce the flow blockage, we have begun to experiment with curved vanes. The 
intent behind this change from the straight vanes is to reduce the inlet angle. A gentler angle 
permits more flow to enter the vane region, after which the curvature increases toward the center 
of the vanes. In this way, the angle smoothly varies between 0 degrees at the outside edge of the 
vanes to a maximum angle at a specified inner radius which depends on the tier of vanes. 
Examples of the curved vanes for the top and bottom levels from the two-tier curved vanes are 
shown below. 

The bottom tier vanes are designed to be approximately the height of the boundary layer, and 
to have a greater final angle than the higher tier. The inner angle is consistent with the final angle 
in the bottom tier for the straight vanes. Likewise, the top tier is designed to have a similar final 
angle as the straight vane case.




While these results are promising, the thermal plume is relatively narrow compared to the 
diameter of the device. It is desirable to broaden the thermal plume, as this in turn creates a 
larger vertical momentum flux due to the effects of buoyancy. This will presumably entrain more 
surrounding fluid, driving it through the vanes and imparting kinetic energy to the flow. The 
kinetic energy grows as the square of the radius, so any broadening of the vortex core can greatly 
enhance the kinetic energy flux. 

As a result, a parallel effort designed to engineer a broader thermal plume has begun this 
quarter. The general physical mechanisms that determine the thermal plume's thickness are not 
presently understood, and so the simulation groups efforts have focused on probing possible 
hypotheses through the addition of general forcing of the velocity field. The driving simulation 
software has been modified in order to permit generic forcing functions that are dependent on 
spatial location as well as state variables, such as the velocity field. In this way, an appropriately 
scaling can be applied to the forcing. 

As shown below, this forcing has substantially broadened the thermal plume as well as lifted 
the thermal resource from the ground into the flow. In turn, this has increased the diameter of the 
dust devil's core.
