An error analysis is performed for the case in which both the velocity and pressure are approximated by \{C0\} interpolations. Combinations of \{C0\} interpolations which are unstable according to the Babuška-Brezzi condition (e.g., equal-order interpolations) are shown to be stable and convergent within the present framework. Calculations exhibiting the good behavior of the methodology are presented. "

abstract = "Computation of compressible flows at low Mach number is often performed by modifications of compressible flow solvers to the low Mach number limit. In particular, time stepping schemes are used where a Poisson problem is solved for pressure updates. In this paper, we propose a different approach for fast computation of stationary solutions. The discretization is made by bilinear and biquadratic finite elements with an elaborated stabilization. It allows the analytical construction of the Jacobian for the whole coupled system. It is used in Newton iterations for solving the nonlinear problems. No time stepping is needed for a wide class of stationary problems. Numerical computations of a benchmark problem for natural convection show the accuracy of the presented method. Different kinds of discretization are compared quantitatively. Furthermore, the aspect of local mesh refinement is addressed. The local refinement is controled by measuring the discretization error of the sought quantity by a posteriori error estimates. This concept is based on solving an adjoint problem which enters in the error estimator as weighting factors of local residuals. "
