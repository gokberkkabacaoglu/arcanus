Our process is the following: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Strong form Navier Stokes + Bouss
 \item Cast into weak form
 \item Prepare as an operator $Lu=f$
 \item Calculate Fr\'echet derivative
 \item Separate into differential (P) and constant (Z) components,
       $L'[u] = P + Z$
 \item Choose stabilization operator such that $S = -P^*$
 \item Then stabilization has form, $a_h(u,\phi) = a(u,\phi) + <Lu,S\phi>_\tau$
\end{itemize}
