 \item Preliminary Results
       \begin{itemize}
        \item need a coherent story here
        \item show some optimization examples, provide story
	\item character of solution(s), observations

 \item Summary and Future Work
       \begin{itemize}
        \item main event!
	\item ``proposed'' new runs and physical investigation
	\item other ideas
	\item rough time line
	\item discuss the program of runs designed to explore a wide configuration space
	\item calibrated turbine
	\item make clear the objective is to assess feasibility, not to prove it can work
