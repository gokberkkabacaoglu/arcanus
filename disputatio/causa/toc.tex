\begin{itemize}
  \item Intro
\begin{itemize}
	\item existence of dust devils and other cyclonic structures
        \item physics of dust devils
	\item probably some stuff about energy
\end{itemize}

  \item Physics of unstable stratified boundary layers
\begin{itemize}
	\item incompressible navier stokes
        \item wind and thermal only (boundary conditions, etc.)
\end{itemize}
  \item apparatus, objective (lab photos)
  \item Penalty Formulation as a modeling tool
  \item turbulence modeling (eddy viscosity )
  \item Validation against gridded and experiment
  \item optimization of power extraction, joint opt. of turbine blade and vane geo
  \item predictions of integrated power extraction: effect of terrain, wind, spacing between devices, thermal resource, etc.
  \item support site-specific economic analysis and sizing
\end{itemize}
